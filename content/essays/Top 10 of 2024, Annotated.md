Top 10 of 2024, Annotated

A retrospective on my Spotify wrapped.
### poster boy

Honestly, this is what I expected for my #1 this year. If I look back at my memory of my listening history, discovering 2hollis is certainly a big part of it. Early in the year I got whiplash in my discovery weekly. Though that song is a bit odd, it does exemplify one of his very interesting features, which is that deeper vocal register. Luckily, poster boy has it too, on a much, much better song. Super catchy, super interesting, and most important for this list, extremely loopable. Regarding that voice, I’m not sure if it’s an effect or just something he can do - I guess I’ll find out when I hear it live. It’s not just this song, though, as all of 2 was very good. Then, with the release of boy, he was solidified as actually good artist in my opinion. He was also my top artist of the year - a sensible slot given I had a journey with two of his albums and multiple singles. I saw him live opening for Ken Carson, and again headlining on his solo tour - both of which were fantastic. Although he didn't play this live either time - which I'm still upset about - the shows were excellent! Very excited to continue following his development as an artist, and 'electroclash' as a genre overall.

### The Bottom - Gracie Abrams

This is somewhat of an embarrassing result for #2, but it’s not like I left it on or it got here by some kind of mistake. I’m sure I played this song hundreds of times, and somewhat deservedly so. I’ve described it as a bad song that sounds really, really good. Though the structure bores me, the disney-channel instrumental fails to compel or intrigue, and the lyrics leave some to be desired, the song is destructively catchy and enjoyable to listen to. Even from the first few words she says, what I find so addictive about Gracie’s music is present. The quiet, gentle, nearly-whispered vocals, that are still deeply rich with tone, texture, and that intoxicating vocal breathiness. 

Continuing the 1:1 mapping, Gracie was also my #2 artist of the year, and again not just because of one song. I bought better IEMs this year, and doing so has deepened my obsession with the aforementioned vocal qualities. I spent significant time deepening my relationship with Good Riddance this year, and another huge interval being disappointed by The Secret of Us. For better and for worse, I’ve spent a lot of time with Gracie’s music this year, and that’s certainly reflected in my Wrapped.

One last note on this song - it's a great summer song. Over the summer, I had a long commute to work, and there was many a summery morning where I wanted to listen to and sing along with this song with my windows down. Though I'll always advocate for critical engagement and analysis, there's something undeniably fun about this genre of upbeat sad-girl pop that makes me want to throw all that away and just sing along.

### Contest - Ravenna Golden
Not an unfamiliar name for me, as Ravenna Golden was the key behind the most interesting part of Black Rum, my #1 song of 2023. Though Contest is not as good, it is still oddly catchy. I spent a lot of time listening to this song at work, and though I think it does deserve a spot in the rotation, if I could slide any song down and out of the top 10, it’d be this one. Not a bad song, by any means, but it doesn't resonate with me the way other songs do in this list. I suppose it strikes a balance between quality and replayability - it's not as good as poster boy, not as fundamentally enjoyable as The Bottom, nor as good for Locking In as the next two entries. Despite all of that - it's appreciably good at all three, which had me coming back to it over and over.

### Wisteria Awakens - Purity Filter
Yeah, this song bangs. It honestly should have been in my list last year. I didn’t immediately latch onto it like I did to Chrysalis, but I actually think this is a more enjoyable song. Maybe it’s just that I inoculated myself with it, and have come to love it after rediscovering it, but either way, it got a ton of plays this year. 

The sampling work is crazy, as the chopped up echoing vocals from Like a G6 is a crazy pull, but one that actually works extremely well. Much like the next song on the list, this is a great song to lock in and focus to, which makes it suitable for listening to at work, which definitely contributes to the play count. 

### i don’t mind staying up late - deathbrain

In terms of good tracks to focus to, this might be top of the list. Catchy, vibey, and importantly does not interrupt my cognition. I can happily keep coding away while this song is playing - and if I unfocus, I can vibe with the song for a short time and then lock back in. That’s not a mark against the song - it is extremely catchy despite not having lyrics, and was a total staple for me this year while focusing on coding.

### 6-10

Past what’s shown on Wrapped, I’m honestly really pleased with my 6-10, as well. First is Pressure + Layers by BIGBABYGUCCI. I really didn’t think I listened to it *that* much this year - but I’m glad I did. Super tight, well produced, catchy rap song that’s perfect for those great days, summer drives, or times when I’m just in the mood to rap along. At just over a minute and a half, this song says all it needs to, and no more. Total heater.

Sliding into seventh is Splinter by Spill Tab. This track will absolutely get its own review, as it’s such a banger. It feels like a sleeper hit for me: a fairly unassuming track that has me coming back over and over - the drop into the chorus at the end always gets me moving. I love this song - and it’s a great one for sharing, too. Many a friend I have recommended it too, and I’ve only gotten praise back.

Eighth is You always wanted me by Psych. I’m a sucker for the high-pitched vocals, and though this isn’t my proudest placement, it was inevitable that some guilty pleasure song ended up in the top 10. Unfortunately enjoyable to sing along to, and impossible to recommend. Despite that, if you take this song at face value, it's an enjoyable bop that'll have you hyped for that "suuuuuuukiiiiiii" time and time again.

Ninth is Attaway, by Phantogram. I first came to know Phantogram through a recommendation from a friend - the track Fall In Love. I genuinely believe it's one of the best songs of all time, and I've listened to it hundreds of times since. Their new album, Memory Of A Day, has some great tracks on it, first and foremost: Attaway. Though it's no Fall In Love, it is an excellent track that's highly enjoyable and replayable.

Finally - light, by 2hollis. By far the most catchy and replayable song from his latest album boy, which I'll talk about at length in my upcoming review of that album. The short of it is that I love this track, and the album it appears on. Extremely catchy, deeply enjoyable, and highly loopable. Moreover, I am happy to support 2hollis as an artist, as he is an innovative artist who does amazing work - as the whole album was self-written and self-produced. He consistently delivers great tracks that range from crushingly intense to energetic and danceable, and for that, I'm happy he appears in my top 10 twice. With how much I listened to both 2 and boy this year, it's no surprise.

Overall, I’m really pleased with my Wrapped this year. Though as always, my top few songs are things I looped for many hours, I’m happy they’re representative of greater arcs I had. Beyond the top 5, the songs that occupy 5-10 are also a nice mix of artists, genres, and styles of song.

As a bonus, my whole Top 100 is embedded below. Hope you'll find something you like!
