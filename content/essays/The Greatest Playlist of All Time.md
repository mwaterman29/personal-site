The Greatest Playlist of All Time

A reflection on what I believe to be the best playlist ever, and why it's such an amazing discovery engine.

There's a real beauty in a good playlist. Of course, there are basic playlists - covering a certain artist, loose genre, or even just a set of songs that you like. Nothing wrong with that, but the real art is a higher-order of playlist building: blending genres, artists, and emotions to build a unique collection of songs. Better still - when you only know some of the songs, this works as an engine for discovery. Of all the playlists I've ever seen - there is one that's obviously the best. If someone had never heard music before, this is would I would hand them to begin their journey. Despite the name and thumbnail seeming a bit goofy, this is legitimately an unbelievable archive of incredible songs, artists, and genres - one that cultivates an amazing vibe on your first pass through it or your hundredth listen. Though I'm inclined to highlight almost every song here - 

Before outlining what I see as the highlights, it's useful to get a sense for the common themes and sounds of the overall playlist. Let's start with the first song - Dark Beach, from Pastel Ghost's 2015 album 'Abyss'. Plainly an awesome witch house, chill, synthwave record, and one that perfectly displays what I would say is the cornerstone trait of this playlist. In every way of form and function - naming, sound, cover art, etc - it is perfectly exemplary of what makes a good nighttime song. Moreover - Abyss is a good album from a good artist, and is a perfect entry point for this space. 

Continuing to the second - HAUNTED, by Isabel LaRosa, which is another incredible track. The powerful vocals, chilling melody, and effective lyricism all work together well for a track that is, fittingly, quite haunting. The rest of her work, albeit similar, has many excellent, standout songs: i don't forgive you, HEARTBEAT, HELP, butterflies, and many more.  Further still - track three - Shadow Lady by Portwave. Three tracks in - and I'm already running low on adjectives to describe how the bassline, percussion, and melody all synergize to really drive the track forward. Across all these initial tracks, there are common threads of the music being digital or synthetic, ethereal and otherworldly, cold and dark. If those vibes are compelling to you, as they are to me, then I cannot recommend this playlist highly enough.

These initial tracks also speak to the power of this collection as a discovery engine. Although Portwave doesn't have a dozen songs I'd recommend like I would for Isabel LaRosa or Pastel Ghost, there are still absolutely further links to incredible albums and artists. Scrolling to the bottom on Spotify, you get easily to Axius Link's 2021 ERA - an unbelievable witch house album. Or, via the Fans Also Like section, to liue, the progenitor of Suffer With Me and the many compelling synthwave, phonk, suitable-for-night-driving songs that sample it. Even if you didn't find liue now, you would have two tracks later with Out of Time by Harley Reid. From the very beginning, it's immensely clear that the tracklist is dense with incredible songs, albums, and artists - and that it serves a set of dozens of gateways to go on journeys of musical discovery.

Given the sheer density of these 'gateways' - I'll choose a few that were meaningful for me - songs and artists I didn't know before listening here, but now really cherish. 

Towards the beginning of the playlist, you'll see a number of Mixed Matches tracks. Maybe, Dark, and best of all Peroxide, which is genuinely one of my favorite songs. The combination of the airy, ethereal vocals, dreamy beats, and cloud-rap percussion makes for a great listen. Mixed Matches has too many highlights to list here - but I'd at very least recommend the 2022 self-titled album and the standout singles where you roam, enclosed, and I never cared about you. Years later, and I still love these songs. When I listen to Peroxide - I'm focused on the gentle, wispy vocals, floating over the instrumental, enveloping me as a listener. At the end of these listens - I reflect: what an incredible song. Thanks to - of all things - a playlist called "Elden Ring Music" for gifting me this track.

Just one track after Peroxide's appearance - "it's hard :/" from oaf1. Though probably best categorized as 'hyperpop', it feels really unique, and they blend genres across the standout tracks. The bouncy synth melody, panning compressed vocals, and catchy chorus have had me coming back to this song for years. Although the lyrics are a bit... dumb, I can't help but love them: "My life is it done yet? Wrap it up like a spider". No, it's not the most compelling lyricism of all time, but it's undeniably enjoyable and catchy. That said, my favorite oaf1 song comes a little later: poster. What initially presents itself as a grimy rock song, with the distant, clattering percussion and muddy, reverberant guitar, turns quickly into this amazing, hypnotic darkwave track. As the eponymous "I was hanging like a poster" comes in, it's underpinned by a truly perfect alternating synth melody. The contrast between the bright digital synth and the synergistic dark guitar, deep bass, and haunting lyrics is plainly incredible. At just two minutes, this song is punchy, tight, and leaves me wanting more even hundreds of listens deep. oaf1 is an eccentric, versatile artist - click on any of the top 5 on spotify and they're all different - one that I simply would not have found without this playlist. 

Speaking of dark guitar, let's talk about quannnic, and their standout "life imitates life", which of course finds a spot on this playlist. It is completely unique - I cannot find a single track that feels the same. It opens on a low-res sample of a Guitar Hero dev video, with this heavy, gazey guitar stumbling in, establishing itself as the chatter continues. Finally coming to a head with the iconic guitar slams under the "If you walked in my skin...". It is truly a vibe like no other. It's inconceivable to me that an obscure, behind-the-scenes bonus video for an Xbox 360 game works so perfectly as the intro for one of the most effective shoegaze songs I've ever heard. Quannnic's no one-hit-wonder either - their other track 'snarky' is in competition for the best guitar tone of all time. Again, it comes in after a loose intro - right as the vocals come in with "I could resign..." there's this beaming, radiant top guitar melody that cuts perfectly through the heavy, distorted bassline and crushing percussion. The whole album kenopsia, is a great one; I honestly don't know if I'd have ever found it without this playlist. I was never a huge shoegaze fan - I'm still not - but "life imitates life" is simply undeniable, and the first place I heard it was on Elden Ring Music. 

I truly owe many a favorite song, late-night listening session, and even enjoyable concert to this playlist, and for that, I'm really grateful. If I was not already such an avid music listener, then the songs here would be an even more insightful collection. I'm God, by Clams Casino, sampling Imogen Heap is my pick for the [greatest instrumental of all time](https://www.mwaterman.dev/music/Clams%20Casino%20-%20I'm%20God.md) , and it's directly included on this playlist. Sewerslvt has a few inclusions here - my favorite breakcore/dnb artist, who made [one of the best albums, ever](https://www.mwaterman.dev/music/Sewerslvt%20-%20we%20had%20good%20times%20together%2C%20don't%20forget%20that.md). Or - Crystal Castles, with many of their best songs (Suffocation, Empathy, Crimewave) woven throughout the playlist. Though I independently love these artists, and had for years before finding this playlist, I am no less happy to see these songs included here. I hope that this playlist may be a gateway to some of these artists for others as it was for me with quannic, oaf1, and Mixed Matches.

Before wrapping up, I'd offer this playlist one more dimension of praise. It's often really ahead of it's time, early to the party on a number of amazing artists - showing real discerning, trendsetting taste from its creator. For example - After Dark by Mr.Kitty - now sitting over a billion plays, with much less than that when initially added to the playlist. Imogen Heap's 'Headlock' is getting the respect it deserves as one of the best pop songs of all time now - but when it was first added to this playlist, that really was just starting to be the case. Even better - my favorite electroclash artist, 2hollis. Safety, from White Tiger was added to this playlist in early 2023 - even before the release of 2 - let alone his meteoric rise after that. I could go on - early Laura Les, Snow Strippers, or catching the electroclash revival early - but I'll leave it there. I'll have to keep an eye on this playlist to know what'll be cool in a couple years when new stuff gets added.

Wrapping up - I hope I have demonstrated how this playlist is a true treasure trove of incredible tracks. No, not every great artist appears here - the jumps to a Porter Robinson, Yves Tumor, or MF DOOM are pretty unclear - this playlist covers so much fantastic music. It is hard to overstate the immense breadth and depth that's covered by this playlist. If I have any call to action - it is to give it a once over. Not just what I highlighted here - I didn't even cover my!lane, Pearly Drops, or Vierre Cloud - among many others. Wait for a quiet night, a long drive, or a time you're hungry for new music. Then - throw this playlist on. I promise, it won't disappoint.
