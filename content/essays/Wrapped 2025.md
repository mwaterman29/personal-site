Wrapped 2025
A retrospective on my Spotify wrapped, year 2

### 1. KRYSTAL KLEAR!

!SE track/4ZamLqgceYEWwAInoLTsfu 80

Well, it's no surprise that this is my top song with nearly 500 listens. At just under two minutes, it's easy to rack up listens, and I spent many hours at work looping this song. It's one of the catchiest songs I've ever heard - probably in the top 5 of all time. I love the groovy instrumental, flawless percussion, and choppy vocals. This song really feels like it has something special - a perfect synergy between the percussion and vocal chops that makes it beyond addictive. I actually think it helps that the vocal chops aren't in English - that extra inability to understand it transforms the vocals into another melodic element, which I always love. If I had to pick just one way to praise this song - it's that, when returning to write this, I looped it for another few hours. I enjoyed every second of it. 

### 2. angel candles

!SE track/7cl1kr7pqaXdDov0lf6cQq 80

On one hand, angel candles is an amazing song, one I listened to a perfect 333 times, and one I plan to put on my top song year-end list. On the other hand, it feels so not obvious *why* this song is so amazing. The intro and outro both feel stumbling, the vocals are cold and even a bit thin, and the melody is impossible to follow on first listen. Despite all of that - the song is perfect. Plainly perfect. It's haunting, ethereal, immensely engaging, raucously enjoyable, and undoubtedly deserving of the hundreds of listens. I'm obsessed with the rapid, bleeping triplet of the melody under the eponymous "angel candles". It's not just that either - the way the instrumental bends, accelerates, and pulses to fit the vocals is insanely engaging. This song is the perfect combination: an inaccessible, otherworldly, chilling sound; a straightforward, easy-listening, verse-into-chorus structure - allowing clear focus on the details of the bright, digital melody against the echoing vocals. Even with over three hundred listens, I still feel like I have more to learn from this song. If that's not a testament to the quality of this song - I don't know what is.

### 3. Dancing with your eyes closed

!SE track/1QkeomwCeKgXOEWoMHzrXr 80

It's inevitable that a Jane Remover song would appear on this list - Revengeseekerz is absolutely my #1 album this year, both by listening, and by score. As I wrote in my review of this song, this track is bright, danceable, and a perfect mix of what makes that album fantastic. I really hope that music like this is the future of pop - retaining the easily-remembered lyrics and upbeat disposition, while bringing in punchier production, better bass and drums, and just a touch of digicore for good measure. It's probably the most 'fun' track I heard this year, and I still feel the urge to dance every time I hear that "You don't even exist!". 

### 4. crescent

!SE track/1iKOW0Q8ZqkzKJe0UztIg8 80

This is a bit of an odd one - this is actually a remix of Crescent Sun from last year's AG Cook album, Britpop. Though I like that song a lot - particularly for its bright instrumentation - I love this remix so much more. It takes the best aspects of crescent sun and adds better bass, more percussive elements, and a certain groove that has me constantly returning to it. Originally - I found this on youtube, under the title "what genre of music is this called?". Though I'm not quite sure - some mix of hyperpop, jerk, and 2000s core - I'm sure of one thing: I can't get enough of it. 

### 5. Re:re: I made a snail pancake

!SE track/43VVzZgymtcFRtlluQhxC8 80

As I wrote in my essay on inevitable and idiosyncratic tracks, this song is completely, utterly singular. There are songs with chopped up, high-pitched vocals, similar upbeat dispositions, but nothing quite like this. Lacking touchpoints to compare it to, I can only suggest listening to it as an exercise to the listener. It's catchy and loopable in a really unique way - even among these other songs that are catchy, unique, and loopable. Even years after my first listen, I still just adore it. Despite pretty much everything about it being a bit odd, it's one of the best songs I've ever heard. 

### 6. victim

!SE track/3Qr8wh35USvFrR4jYQtT4h 80

Although this isn't exactly the lexycat song I might have chosen for this spot, I can't deny that I love it. She's been on an absolute tear this year - releasing a number of amazing singles in addition to her album, one of which is victim. This song pushes the internet digicore sound, relying on tons of samples, but I find them to be effective - even if they are from CS:GO and FNAF. I like the contrast between the pitched-up vocals and the reverberant low-end, especially the delivery of "like, I'm into it". Though I don't think you'll get much mainstream praise of a song like this, you will from me. 

### 7. angels in camo

!SE track/7a4dV5aM4pHsTdOkqIVK8l 80

Surprise - more Jane Remover. Since I've talked about Revengeseekerz at length on its own review, and above for song #3, I'll instead offer an anecdote. Sparing the details, earlier this year, I finished upgrading my sound system at home. Tldr, when cranked, it'd be outputting nearly ~110dB, aka hearing damage with in a few minutes. To test this, I put earplugs in, made sure no one was home, and then cranked my subwoofer and speakers until I couldn't hear myself think. The absolute colossal, slamming, ripping bass hit after "you let the creeps in!" of this song had my entire house shaking. If they couldn't hear Jane's vocals - I'd bet my upstairs neighbors would think there was an earthquake. The repeated, rapid bass stabs nearly knocked everything off my coffee tables, and I think the glass break sample after "Dear God!" almost broke my actual windows. Very few songs allow you to trade structural integrity for listening experience, which makes this song special. As I wrote in my review of the album, Revengeseekerz is an album that demands to be listened to loud. I think I've accomplished that now. 

### 8. JRJRJR

!SE track/1mW9XrT9XdnsDPuthSgusZ 80

Rounding out Jane's inclusion on this list is JRJRJR - the first single leading up to the latest album. I was not expecting this new sound from her, especially following on the other recent singles of Flash In The Pan and Magic I Want U, but I love the new direction. Coming off of Frailty and Census Designated, I was expecting another hyperpop, shoegaze, noise rock album, and what we got instead was an explosive, amazing album from end-to-end. I really appreciate that JRJRJR was the gateway to that new sound. Though the song is a bit messy, it feels more like it's just bursting with energy, rather than being assembled without care. Although I'm still not sure I understand "feel like Jesus in the mosh pit // Mary on the cross with her friends", the song is just too energetic for me to care. Beyond the sheer energy, I love the music video, the homeswitcher sample as a nod to her older work, and the slower end of the track - all further points for the quality of the track. With all this considered, I'm happy to have this song land in the top ten. 

### 9. G6 anthem

!SE track/0rq8Vr1Rwjgf97tAcT9EkN 80

The first time I heard this song, I was honestly overwhelmed. The high-pitched, staccato beat, distorted bass, and frenetic vocal delivery was too much to parse. However - even after that first listen, it started to worm its way into my brain. Each time I returned to it, it grew on me a bit more, and now I think it's the best song on that album. The stuttering, syncopated beat and rapid bass hits are really engaging, and I can't help but laugh at "if looks could kill, I'd be the most wanted terrorist". All in all a great song from a great album, and one I'm sure to keep enjoying well into next year. 

### 10. Ninacamina

!SE track/7mnnneke9KNVkwjPmMB7EY 80

This has been a huge year for Ninajirachi - I Love My Computer is an amazing album, one received well by fans and critics alike. I love the album, and her tour was one of the most fun live shows I've ever been to, easily. At that show, I heard Ninacamina, and quickly became obsessed. Almost every part of this song is incredibly catchy, and it's super loopable. The combination of the breathy, spacey, almost ethereal delivery, the cryptic lyrics, and the repeated phrases make the vocals insanely engaging, and they complement the beat well. The stripped back drop, pulsing bass, and straightforward structure make for easy listening, time and time again. Ninajirachi always has amazing features, and this song is no exception. Every time I listen to this song, I'm teleported back to the basement venue where she played live - surrounded by other fans, dancing, jumping, singing along to the lyrics - and that's a memory I'll cherish for years to come.

### In Closing

As with past years, I'm happy with the full list. Even continuing to 11 and 12, we find poster boy, my top song of last year, and In My Room, breakout hit from Julia Wolf, another artist I found this year. Further into the list, there's many more songs from my top artists - nearly a dozen 2hollis songs, a similar number from Jane Remover, a handful of Yves Tumor and Gracie Abrams songs, it's a perfect mix. There's also great representation of some of the best albums this year - we see a sneak peek of what might appear on my top songs list - Ninajirachi, aftrr!, lexycat, and more. I don't think there's a single song in the top 100 that I don't love - maybe there's a few guilty pleasure songs, and maybe I listen to too much electroclash - but this was an amazing year for music. As with last year, I've included a playlist link to my full top 100 list here. Hopefully you'll find something you enjoy. Onto the next!
