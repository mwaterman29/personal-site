An app to help climbers track their progress over time - without ads or needing to pay.



This was a project for COMP.4631 - Mobile App Design II. I worked with my classmate Aidan, as we both climb, and we recognized the need for an app like this. Though [Crimpd](https://www.crimpd.com/) has since eaten our lunch, we still have some utility, insofar as we didn't compromise for monetization, as it was a class project.

We used React Native, as Aidan hadn't used it before - and I wanted to expand my knowledge of React to be able to build cross-platform apps. For styling, we used Tailwind, as there's a finicky but functional plugin to get it working w/ Expo.
