There is a euphoria only experienced at night. Though I hope that every reader would have experienced it, for those who haven't, it's difficult to put into words. I have only vignettes of this feeling, clarified in retrospect, rather than during the experience. It feels like overlooking a dark body of water, as the wind ripples the reflections of the stars in it. It feels like a winter's night, feeling the cold bite at your face, but with a warmth internally. As a car enthusiast, it feels like downshifting, accelerating, and feeling yourself pulled back on the drive home.

Often, this is a feeling only met in silence. Allowed to rise up when you’re free from distractions, and allowed to sit with your thoughts. If there is any song that bests the silence - it’s this one. The original Jackie, a strong track from legendary artist Yves Tumor, gets at this idea, too, but the recontextualization under Jvne’s sound palette speaks to me on a level I didn’t know music could. This revision and upgrade to the sound and style drastically improves on what is already an exceptional track.

The main difference that absolutely solidifies this song as one of the best I have ever heard is audible from the very start -  this gripping, driving, electronic countermelody that moves me like no other. The original opening riff is still present, but it’s preempted by the opening of this melody, which is so deeply compelling. As the original big guitar slam comes in, the source melody is reprised in a new sound, and the second melody complements it, this song has me completely drawn in. It is simply one of the most deeply gripping melodies I have had the pleasure of experiencing. The vocal remake is also very interesting - I think the tone of the vocals fits better than the original would - particularly as syllables are held and they almost sound chopped up. Of course, the percussion is also excellent, as it is across her whole discography. Out of these layers emerges a perfect song.

I cannot praise the sound of this song enough. A mashup of two of my favorite artists, coming together to create one of my favorite songs. More than the sound, though, I love what this song complements in my life. Many long night drives are improved by this song, shaped by the sound of it, cultivating a feeling that’s hard to get in other places. 

I have a deep appreciation for this song - one that is unlike others. It’s not the same gratitude I hold towards early Clairo or MF DOOM for their role in my growth as a music listener. Nor is the same awe I have towards other songs of similar quality - even from the same artists - like Heaven Surrounds Us Like a Hood, or all the joy in life was gone once you left. Instead, there is a separate sort of reverence I hold towards this track. The concept is somewhat nebulous, but it feels most like a climbing wintry mountain in my head. Effortful engagement under particular conditions begets a learning about oneself. I look at this song in much the same way. There’s a respect, earned from some sense of fear. Not from whether you can get through it, but from what you might learn about yourself while you do.

Ultimately, I think that is where the euphoria of a cold night stems from. In the modern world, it’s easy to run from your thoughts, and overwrite them with distractions. To put that all to the side, and to just feel, can be intense. If you have things left unprocessed, it can be a shocking, visceral, and initially negative experience. However, coming out the other side with a renewed sense of self is freeing in a fundamental way. This sense of freedom, internal tranquility, and revelatory confidence, is satisfying in a way that’s deeper than the first-order pleasure of a song that sounds good.

When I take my next deep breath on a quiet winter’s night, looking at the stars, this is what I’ll be listening to. There is no higher praise I can offer than that.
