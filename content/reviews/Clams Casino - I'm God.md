I'm God
Clams Casino

I've spent a lot of time thinking about instrumentals, particularly in rap. Though I'll always appreciate great lyricism, the beat obviously is a critical factor in shaping a song's sound. Sometimes, they're so good that the beat is the primary reason I'll come back to the song - think Transgression by Kodak Black, Waster by Bladee, or Steppa Pig by JPEGMAFIA. Great tracks without a doubt, but standouts for their instrumentals, not for their lyrics. Even rarer are instrumentals so good that they live a life of their own - completely beyond the original song. There are only a few examples of this that come to mind: Overdue from Metro Boomin, Tell 'Em with Cochise & $NOT - both tracks I'll happily listen to in their instrumental versions. When I really think about instrumentals, though, none are better than I'm God, by Clams Casino.

This is, of course, a descendant of Imogen Heap's *Just for Now*, which I wrote about at length in my recent review of her 2005 album Speak for Yourself, on which it appears. This review serves as a corollary, providing context for one of the many, many wonderful songs that descend from the tracks on Speak For Yourself. On its own, Just for Now deserves all the praise it gets - the heavenly, glowing vocals, beautiful arrangement, and detailed percussion. However, as I said - I can't listen to that song without hearing I'm God - and for good reason. 

I believe this to be the best instrumental, bar none, so much so that it's ascended to being one of the best songs of all time. Just For Now is already a standout pick among great electropop tracks, a genre I have loved for my whole life. I'm God is that song, perfected. It retains every bit of the shining, heavenly nature of the vocals, using them to create a foundational track for cloud rap. By chopping, looping, and re-layering her vocals, Clams Casino creates a truly otherworldly and spiritual track. It feels like her vocals, with their whispered texture and distant reach, become icy wisps on this track. There is no better word for it than otherworldly - it is ethereal, chilling, mystical, an auditory glimpse into another world. The way they're chopped, reconstructed, and recontextualized makes for an extremely enjoyable listen. On *Just for Now*, the vocals feel gentle and clear, shaped byaudible breaths over that soft piano, with evocative lyrics of 'bite tongue, deep breaths, count to ten'. Hearing these same vocals and lyrics transformed from warm to chilling; grounded to diaphanous - is deeply engaging, and a further testament to the quality of this song.

On the topic of distance - that's another departure from the original, one that works to great effect. On Just for Now, the main vocals are quite clear and forward which is very effective in the original context, conveying the details cleanly and directly. Here, though, they are far off, fading in gently, drawing the listener in immediately. The lone 'how did you know... it's what I've always wanted...' from afar, sounding constrained and distant before, further pushing the feeling that this song is a glimpse into an expansive soundscape.

Finally, the percussion. I already enjoy the percussion on Just for Now - it's gentle and unobtrusive, providing nice detail and texture to contrast the vocals. However, the percussion on I'm God is on another level, and it suits my taste very well. It's no secret that I'm a big fan of fast percussion - primarily in breakcore/atmospheric D&B - but it's great here too. The varied, rapid hi-hats are a wonderful foil to the vocals, and are appropriately placed and mixed. Moreover, I'm also a fan of the heavy clap - although some may think it's overmixed, I argue it punctuates the instrumental well, and you'll notice its absence, which is effective at keeping the listener's attention. 

Iâ€™ve spent a lot of time thinking about instrumentals... and none reward that thinking more than this one. It is the perfected version of one of my favorite songs, from one of my favorite albums, by two of the best living producers in Imogen Heap and Clams Casino. Moreover, it is a truly foundational, cornerstone track for cloud rap, a genre that I've come to love, and one that was just in its infancy when this instrumental was created. This song is incredible not just for its perfect sound, but for its long-lasting legacy, which we still hear in modern cloud rap releases to this day. This song has accompanied many late night drives and train rides, hours spent staring out the window, or looking up at my ceiling or the stars - and I'm sure it will continue to do so for years to come.
