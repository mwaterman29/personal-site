Worlds is undoubtedly one of the most influential EDM albums its time, offering bright, expansive, harmonious production to a genre that was much more focused on sawtooth bass and wub-wub tropes than building beautiful soundscapes. By fusing synthpop and electropop elements into the synthetic sound palette of mid-2010s EDM - Porter delivers an ambitious and beautiful album from end-to-end. But that's not really why I like the album, or even what I'm going to talk about here. I look at this album in retrospect, not only over a decade out from its release, but years after Nurture, which is one of my favorite albums of all time. In this review, I don't feel the need to talk about its legacy, forward-thinking sound, compelling worldbuilding - as that's not true to my experience with this album. I have a much more fragmented experience with this album, listening to some of the singles for years, but only coming back to it as a full album recently. Thus, that is how I will analyze it. In this review, I'll describe my dual love for this album: first for its standout tracks; second for it laying the groundwork for one of my favorite albums of all time. 

To start, I'd like to touch on a couple highlights. Looking at the tracklist, the standout tracks are clear, and unlike many albums, the streaming numbers do actually indicate the best songs on this album. In ascending order, the third-most streamed - but my favorite on the album - is the opening track: Divinity !SM. It's one of my favorite songs, and I'd even go so far as to call it one of the best EDM songs of all time. For years, I have been captivated by the choppy, vocal-like synth stabs that are the foremost element of this song. From the very first seconds of this song, it's extremely gripping, and that feeling has not diminished whatsoever from the first dozen listens to now when I'm on my five hundredth or even thousandth listen. The slamming bass and drums work well to scaffold the choppy melody, and move the song forward. This powerful start is only half the song; the other half being the slower sections with a gentler melody underpinning Amy Millan's vocals. As the instrumental rises up under the repeated "We will wait for this", before, of course, a huge drop, her vocals shine triumphantly. The contrast between the two makes both of them hit even harder - making the soft vocals more compelling, the arpeggiated melody even brighter, and the bass even punchier. The huge variety of layers keep the song interesting as it progresses, leading into both halves coming together towards the end, again the refrain of "We will wait for this" over the incredible instrumental. Finally, it moves to the denouement - as the instrumental is winding down, the final lyric of "You see right through me" fits my taste perfectly. Audibly breathy with the gently plinking chimes under it. Every second of this song is wonderfully arranged and engaging. Divinity is truly an awesome song from end-to-end, and has been a definitional cornerstone of my taste in electronic music for years. 

The other immediate standout is the most streamed song, Sad Machine !SM. The opening is absolutely iconic, with those three bright, airy, digital chimes that serve as the backbone for the melody. As the percussion comes in, the melody continues and immediately cements itself as one of the best. Again, an extremely gripping opening to the track. Every time I hear it, I am immediately teleported back to the live shows - letting someone in the audience play the first three, or him tapping away at the midi pad to play the melody. As I wrote for Nurture, these live shows were very emotional for me, and I look back extremely fondly on them. Most emotionally moving for me, though, is the lyrics - the dialog between Porter's own voice and the synthetic vocals of Avanna - which perfectly fill in the structure of this song. The "We depend on you, we depend - I'll depend - on you" is absolutely incredible, and is perhaps the most perfectly executed build-into-drop sequences of the entire genre. Those couple seconds where everything drops away, and it's just the lone, synthetic "I'll depend on you" perfectly sets up the huge drop back into the melody, supported well by rich bass and clean kicks. It amazes me how well the melody works as the setup and the payoff - it's present during the build, underpinned by a riser, and yet despite that, it's just as viscerally exciting when it drops. As the song ends, refraining with warmer strings, I reflect on the incredible structure, arrangement, and tone of the track I just listened to. I remember a car ride with my parents, when I was probably fifteen, being moved by this song even through tinny wired apple earbuds. Many years later, and it still moves me to near tears. Iconic, quintessential, wonderful standout track from Worlds, and I'm so glad to have had it accompany my life for so long. 

Before continuing to the third and final standout track, I'd like to continue on the sound of the final melodic refrain on Sad Machine - as it frames my next lens well. Looking back, I can't help but feel that the lush tone begins to feel a bit like Nurture. I hear elements of this sound in other tracks, too - like on Natural Light !SM. Originally, I was going to treat Natural Light like an interlude, and exclude it from review. Returning to it, though, it demonstrates this point well. There is a brightness to the chimes, over the gentle humming instrumental that I find to be somewhat nurturesque. Though the vocal chops are a bit odd and unrefined, they feel like a perfect middle-ground between the choppy, energetic sampling of his earlier work, and the moving, inner-voice type synthetic vocals that appear on Nurture. There are moments of this all throughout the record, sparse moments that feel more organic, bright, and beautiful. Ultimately, this feeling is clearest to me on Sea Of Voices !SM, which could almost fit in amongst Nurture's tracklist. The distant chimes, sparse composition, and slow build feels very similar to Wind Tempos from Nurture. Though the payoff is different here - airy, arpeggiated synths and gentle vocals in place of piano - it's still excellent. Porter has a real talent for this sort of song, and I'm happy to see this parallel between the two albums when I return to them. 

Conversely - what detracts from these songs, generally, is sounding less like Nurture, more like club EDM. It's not that I inherently dislike artists Tiesto, Baauer, or Knife Party - I might even call myself a fan of all three - it's moreso that it represents two different eras of Porter Robinson as I experience his music. Put simply - there's Nurture (good), and Spitfire (not good) - and moments on here that sound more like the Spitfire era, sounding dated or unexceptional. For example - Lionhearted !SM feels like a budget MGMT / Oracular Spectacular track to me - and that's only partially a compliment. Primarily - the vocals just don't land for me, not on the chorus or during the voices. Moreover, I don't find the lyrics particularly compelling either, I'm plainly unmoved by the call to be 'the lionhearted'. I really like the sound of the instrumental, but the vocals they platform are underwhelming. Similarly on Hear The Bells !SM - I'm torn on this track. I largely enjoy the 'Can't you hear the bells sing in Cologne?' but the arrangement feels just a little too big, too grandiose, to be truly enjoyable. It has just one drop of that "Stomp Clap Hey" positivity - not enough to entirely poison the track and make it unenjoyable, but just enough to have me slightly rolling my eyes. I think this vibe was a lot more common then, but has not aged incredibly well. 

To close this review, let's return to the second-most streamed track, the closer, the one with the highest score from me - Goodbye to a World !SM. If Sad Machine doesn't have the perfect build-into-drop sequence, then this song certainly does. The first two minutes serve to build the tension, with synthetic vocals punctuated by slow piano and gentle pacing. With the refrain of "I will surround you, and give life to a world // that's our own" comes in, the song changes entirely. The searing, bending, pulsing top synth makes for a perfect contrast to the earlier section. The second drop is even better - and really solidifies this track as the perfect closer - the build is higher, the drop is heavier, the synth is richer, the melody is longer and more interesting, and it all works together perfectly. The song ends on a final broken vocal refrain: strained, glitchy, and fading, resolving what is "the end of the world" to be, literally, the end of "Worlds". Compelling, explosive, and deeply enjoyable to listen to - I have nothing but good things to say about this song. 

This final track, and really the whole album is exemplary of why electronic music is so enjoyable - straightforward building of tension into release, through the use of bright, dynamic, and punchy instrumentation. Porter takes it further, building engaging soundscapes that are much more intriguing, compelling, and emotional than average club EDM. No, this album is not as beautiful or moving as Nurture. But that doesn't mean it's not a beautiful and moving album. Between the standout tracks, glimpses of Porter's future as an artist, and the long life and legacy this album has already enjoyed in its first decade, it is abundantly clear that Worlds is an incredible album, and I look forward to spending another decade with it.
