Lost It
Virtual Riot

I’ve listened to this song so many times, it’s become hard to review. I think that’s praise of this song, though. 

It feels like the perfect future bass track - nice female vocals over a clean and enjoyable build into drop. I really every element of it - and am particularly hooked in by the “I guess you lost it” leading into the drop.

Structurally, this song holds up as well as any other - if you tolerate this type of song, you’ll likely enjoy this one. There’s no doubts that Virtual Riot is more than competent as a producer, which comes through nicely here.

I find the drop a little difficult to discuss - as I think I somewhat lack to vocabulary for discussing EDM like this. I think the lead in is super clean - 'The times you spent feeling weightless, you know I loved it. Now you seem to have my heart in your big chest. I guess you lost it.' The tone, attitude, and feeling that are carried through these few lines is insanely strong. I also really appreciate that the introductory melody is present here too, over what sounds like the ticking of a clock, which slows down riiiiiiight as the drop approaches. The composition of these elements makes for a really compelling lead up.

Continuing into the first drop, punctuated by a sharp inhale, the song continues to be excellent. A really clean main synth, accompanied by vocal chops, an 8-bit countermelody, and straightforward drum pattern, all makes for a catchy and punchy main drop. I'm so addicted to that 'woah-oh' that's present in a few places during the song.

The bridge isn't too special, but does a good job continuing the structural elements and motifs of the song.

What really pushes this song to being exceptional for me is the second drop. The lead in is again, fantastic - 'seconds seem to fly' - with the word fly being just so pleasant. The structure is actually meaningfully different for the second drop, as well, as there's a bit more bassy wub-wub, refrain of the vocals, and my beloved 'woah-oh'. I love the 'I count the seconds til you -' and 'I guess you lost it' that cut back in as well.

Overall, I'm a big fan. As the song ends, I often find myself wanting to restart it, and I often do just that. As I see it, this song will likely stay a favorite and solidly in my rotation when I'm hungry for easy listening EDM / future bass.
