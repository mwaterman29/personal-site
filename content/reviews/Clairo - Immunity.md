Immunity
Clairo

Immunity is somewhat of a cornerstone record for me. In high school chemistry, my classmate Nathan recommended Clairo to me with Flaming Hot Cheetos - I don't even think 4EVER was out at the time. Of course, a lot of her earlier work is now super iconic, with diary001 having over a billion total streams, but it did feel appropriately 'indie' and 'underground' at the time. That changed with the release of Immunity.

Really, I owe a lot of my deep love and appreciation for indie & bedroom pop, gentle female vocals, and Clairo herself to this album.

To me, the obvious highlight of this album is the four-track run in the middle: North, Bags, Softly, and Sofia.

North !SM is still my favorite Clairo song to this day, and it's definitely one of my favorite songs. The perfect vocals, wistful lyrics, and incredible production are so compelling to me. There are so many moments on this song that are highlights, it's impossible to discuss them all without just highlighting every line. In every verse, there are multiple little micro-vignettes of longing that are fantastic. 

Though I believe the entire song is a highlight - this song does meaningfully peak for me. Towards the end, as the vocals become ethereal and airy, the bass crescendoes, and the overdriven guitars hit their apex, the song truly cements itself as an all-timer. I love this song, and I have for years. It's beautiful, compelling, and deeply enjoyable to listen to.

Immediately continuing to Bags !SM, the incredible run continues. This is another deeply compelling song, that at times, I believe is her best. The lyrics are incredible - they're a searing portrayal of a tenuous love: simultaneously head-over-heels but barely able to get the words out. In my opinion, this is highlighted most by the last bridge:

"Tell you how I felt
Sugar coated melting in your mouth
Pardon my emotions
I should probably keep it all to myself"

The sound of the second line is just incredible, and it plays with the theming so well. This song is ultimately completely coherent in every detail of the sound, from the gentle guitars and bright piano line - I almost think that if this song had no lyrics, I'd still get the exact story being told.

Truly, a fantastic track. It's beautiful and is still just as enjoyable over five years after its release. 

Softly !SM is a beautiful love song, that feels very genuine and sweet. It feels small, and tender (which again is backed up well by the sound palette), and for that, I respect it. Though it might sound pretentious, I actually find that this song is much better on vinyl. I find the somewhat warmer mixing and detailed vocals to improve the listening experience - the bright piano stabs feel a little cold on the spotify recording - but the vinyl version of this song is exceptional. 

Again, there's an obvious peak for me. I find the very gentle 'Think of ways to ask you "Why don't you come over sometime?", and the following little guitar line to be so pleasant, and it keeps me coming back to this song again and again. 

This album also exceeds at being deeply, deeply sad. The obvious standout here is Alewife !SM, which is just crushing. The soft and intimate vocals, chilling piano, and punchy drums immediately cut right to your heart. The subject matter is obvious, but not in a bad way. Though I appreciate cryptic poetry in lyrics that requires deep engagement to pull apart, I don't think that's necessary here - and it's certainly not beating you over the head with the detail. Sad songs like this, that are internally consistent and tell the story well don't need to be the most complex; simple, direct, down-trodden songs do well to let you just sit with the lyrics and instrumental.

Honestly, it's the guitar in this song that gets me emotionally. When it comes in after the first verse, I feel it pulling right at my heartstrings. Particularly, in the last minute or so, once the vocals are gone - and there's time to just listen and reflect on how you feel - is extremely emotionally compelling. Alewife is a deeply moving and vulnerable track which never fails to feel cathartic, and frequently has me welling up, even to this day.

There's another track, too, that I find to be deeply sad. White Flag !SM is absolutely heart-rending and has me more torn up than any other song in her whole discography. I'm not particularly sure what it is about it - some combination of seeing a past self in the lyrics, the sound of the instrumental, and the times in my life during which I listened to it the most, I guess - but it all makes for a deep personal connection to this song. 

The only criticism I have for this album is the ending. I'm not in love with the last few songs - I just don't find them to affect me like the rest of the album does. They're not bad, by any means, they're still all fairly high scores, and I do enjoy them. But when I find myself wanting to listen to this album, digitally or on vinyl, it's because of alewife, and white flag, and that four-track run in the middle, not the ending.

In closing - I’m really grateful for this record. I love how it sounds, the story it tells, and the place it’s had in my rotation over the past five years. I owe it more than just that, though, as honestly, without this album, I’m not sure my taste would be as wide as it is today. Gracie Abrams, Maude Latour, Devon Again, Juliana Chahayed, and many more, these are all artists I’m not sure I would have the same appreciation for if not for this album. 

Thanks Claire :)
