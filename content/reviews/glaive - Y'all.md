Y'all
glaive

Appalachia native glaive returns with another album. Though his career has been critically mixed, I've been a fan of him for years. Since his first few songs during the pandemic, I've found him to bring an interesting dynamic to hyperpop - a youthful, careless, angsty disposition that enriches the genre. In the five years since his first songs of 'astrid' and 'sick', glaive's grown a lot, and improved as an artist significantly. It brings me great pleasure to say that this might be his best work yet. On Y'all, glaive demonstrates huge growth, furthering his artistic and personal development while delivering a mix of bangers and beautiful songs. 

glaive's artistic and personal trajectory continue strongly here - it's clear that he's more confident now than before, but it's still a shaky confidence. It's emblematic of being in your early twenties, and whether he means to or not, he shows growth. On his earliest work - there was no confidence. Consider the viral 'astrid': "I feel like a puppet controlled animation // And I've never been good at holding conversations". A little later, on 'bastard': "Got a little confident, hear it in how I talk now". Now, there's a new level of confidence - it's clear that he's more mature than the past. Sometimes, this confidence is financial - like on Appalachia !SM, where he talks about buying a house without touching his savings - a big contrast from being unable to handle paying taxes for the first time, as he was on "all i do is try my best". However - this is still measured against what other people think: "I'm scared that they might judge... probably think I'm selling, or that my daddy paid it, or that I'm late on payments". This balance of self-doubt and confidence offers an insightful look at what it means to come of age. This coming of age happens not just as a person, but as a musician - being the only person to come up out of Appalachia and make it in a crowded, west-coast based industry. Again, it's not a purely internal confidence - he's still worried about "getting weird looks every time". The alternating disposition between outward flexing and internal doubts maintain a good balance between being relatable and aspirational, which I appreciate. The first few songs on this album begin to establish a narrative: he's older, wiser, and richer, but not fully secure in that status.

Continuing deeper into the tracklist, glaive returns to form, touching on this insecurity with many angsty moments. His angst has transformed from just hating his hometown; now he's growing up and finding himself disgusted with his peers. Again, I'd say this is a natural part of maturing, finding what you really are and aren't. Glaive explores this through a number of funny lines on great songs. For example, on Veni Vidi Vici !SM, he draws the line - "I'd rather kill myself than end up anything like y'all". Although a bit dramatic, the sentiment is strong, and it's well supported by the rest of the track. The sweeping bass, bright meandering melody, and tongue-in-cheek delivery of "I came, I saw, I fucking left" all work together. On We Don't Leave The House !SM, he explores this further, balancing the social pressure of going out with the desire to keep to yourself. Again, he's disappointed by his peers: "Y'all really like this huh? I've seen enough." I like that, at the end of the track, he decides "Fuck it, let's just hit the clubs". To overcome the anxiety, the urge to stay inside, and to just let yourself have fun is again, a mark of maturity. It's particularly effective that, on the song that is absolutely the most straightforward "club banger" among the tracklist, it's all about staying inside. The intrinsic contrast between the punchy, catchy instrumental and the repeated "we don't leave the house" is fantastic, and balances the mixed emotions very well. Rounding out the middle of the album, glaive continues to explore these ideas well on It Is What It Is !SM. I appreciate the feeling of being an outsider that this song captures. To not even know what sets you apart, but to feel it regardless. He wonders - "Cracked a joke inside the function // It didn't really land, though // Like, why'd nobody laugh, though for real?" The superiority is here, too, saying "I was a kid and you weren't half the man I was". Across all these tracks, it's clear that this album is a lens into glaive's life. Not only as glaive, but as Ash Gutierrez, and I find that to be very compelling.

Beyond the flexing and funny lines, there are many tracks on this album which are genuinely beautiful. Looking back at glaive's discography - a lot of his music is youthful, angsty, abrasive, even a little ignorant - not qualities that usually go with 'beautiful' at all. Here, glaive not only achieves many moments of beauty, they're in a refreshing form. So often, beautiful songs about love and loss are focused on romance, not family. It's refreshing to hear a song that honors his friends and family. For example - on Bluebirds !SM, I particularly appreciate the proverb-type contrasts: "Don't let the things you've lost define the things you have" and "The person that you love ain't the person that they are". Though, as he notes, they are a bit cliché, they fit well over the vulnerable tone and warm brass instrumentation. If I was going through a breakup, it'd mean a lot to hear that "bluebirds fly in flocks // and I'm one call away if you need to talk". A real departure from "fuck this town and like everyone in it" - one that demonstrates growth. In addition to his close friends, glaive reflects on losing his grandparents on Bennie & Kay !SM. The track is an undeniably beautiful closer - one that's deeply moving, and particularly cathartic. It's packed full of lines that are absolutely killer, but the one that gets me the most is 'I hope my children act just like you'. Plainly beautiful and really pulls at my heartstrings. Moreover, I find his voice to be extremely gripping - it feels as if it's sung on the edge of tears, and the wavering, nearly breaking delivery is immensely effective. Finally, the ending quote - 'thank you for honoring me tonight' of course, speaks perfectly to the track itself. To devote the closer to what is undeniably a great album - likely to be his most acclaimed work to date - absolutely honors his grandparents. Ultimately, engaging with good music is about building an emotional connection with it. Given how choked up I felt during my first few listens - I must say that it is a success here. 

Before closing, I'd like to note that this album also sounds fantastic. It's impressive to tell such a good, relatable story of your growth in life. It's doubly impressive to do so through end-to-end bangers. Even from the very first seconds of this album - as the army chant drops into that cutting, astringent synth, there's no doubt that the album is going to rock. On the aforementioned It Is What It Is, I've had the chorus stuck in my head for weeks. The way the bass hits in sync with his delivery of "this **bitch**, goddamn" is a perfect hook. Across We Don't Leave The House !SM, Foreigner !SM, and Weird !SM - I keep reaching for the word 'punchy', and that definitely keeps this album engaging. I feel that often, albums overstay their welcome, pushing one idea just slightly too far. Here, I feel the opposite - almost every song is engaging and refreshing, and that contributes greatly to my enjoyment. There's tons of little details that I love here - the out-of-breath delivery on Modafinil !SM, the spoken intro on Fuck !SM, the spacey breakdown on 9 !SM, and so on. I'm sure that as I approach the hundredth listen, I'll keep picking up on new details to appreciate. If that's not the mark of a great album, I don't know what is.

In closing, this album is immensely impressive. Not only is glaive's sound the best it's been in years, but there's real meaning found in the tracks here. Though I think old dogs, new tricks is still his definitive work, I'm really excited to see how this album will age. I hope to keep finding enjoyment, meaning, and beauty throughout the tracklist. More than just this album - I'm excited for what this means for glaive's career. Among critics and fans alike, his last two albums were mixed bags - some standouts hits, some undeniable missteps. With Y'all, there's a renewed interest in glaive and what he brings to hyperpop. I can't wait to see what he makes next!
