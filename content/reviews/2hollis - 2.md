My original review of this album was pretty concise - "This guy has great production and an insane voice when he's really into it. Honestly thoroughly enjoyed throughout and am looking forward to another full-length project from him. Finish is a little weak imo, but overall quite quality."

Having received another full-length project from him, and seeing him live as he opened for Ken Carson, I'm coming back to it, and I honestly enjoy it even more.

Though I think boy is a better album, this album is really, really good. As I said on boy, hollis alternates between extremely intense and very catchy songs, and does very well in both lanes - sometimes crossing the two for great performances.

Throughout, the production is strong and enjoyable, and he succeeds in both lanes. As far as accessible, well-produced electro/hyperpop - GOD, FORFEIT, blackbirds, and especially poster boy are all extremely strong and just plain enjoyable to listen to.
As far as super intense, there's honestly moments on many songs - but I think a handful stick out - all 2s is a strong opener, the it will never be the same, or fame runner which is just crushing.
Finally, I think when these two pursuits cross, it results in the strongest moments on the album - after the vocal interlude on FORFEIT, the deeper voice on poster boy, the end of nothing2 lose? Insane.

Speaking of the lower voice - I'm a huge fan. I'm honestly pretty resistant to male vocals most of the time - unless they do something interesting. Here - I'm interested. He does it on whiplash (single, not on this album) as well, to great effect. There's just an extremely compelling added layer of depth when his vocals get deeper and louder. It's like downshifting right before you drop the hammer while driving - absolute gas.

Overall, interesting album, well produced, and an impressive showing from 2hollis. Will absolutely keep this in my rotation along with his other work. It wouldn't surprise me if poster boy was in my top 3 songs this year - it's so addictive, so well produced, so loopable, and just a truly incredible song.
