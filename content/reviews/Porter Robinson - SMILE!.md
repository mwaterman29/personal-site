SMILE!
Porter Robinson

SMILE! :D is an album that’s difficult to engage with. There are moments on this album that are vulnerable and moving, but it’s too often wrapped in a veneer of “teehee xd” that clashes and leaves me feeling confused and disappointed. Nurture felt internally consistent in every way - from the major elements of the title and album art to the small details of instrumentation and sound palette, and it was much more beautiful for it. Here, we see a tonal dissonance that hurts the album more than it helps. 

I understand that this album is intentionally dissonant - examining the tension between having everything you’ve ever wanted after critical success, but still facing personal struggles and failings - but I’m not so sure that this dissonance is compelling. 

There’s a “just have fun” element to this album that I generally dislike. I’m not saying that the album isn’t good - it’s just not for me. At least for me - I very much dislike music that tries to be ironic. I get that there’s room for fun, and even at times non-serious music, but I find the attitude of irony really distasteful. A song titled “(brand name) Freestyle” is not what I expected from Porter Robinson and I think it’s worse for it. I vastly prefer the Porter we hear on Musician over “I’ma grow my hair, I’ma blow my cash” - ironic or not. Not to say it's not enjoyable for casual listening, but I don't exactly look to Porter for casual listening. 

Additionally, I think the change in the sound of Porter’s work also doesn’t really appeal to me. There are still many catchy and interesting and very porter-robinson-sounding moments here, but there’s an equal number where it feels as if he’s borrowing elements from pop and punk that just don’t interest me whatsoever. The underlying production quality is absolutely still there - there's no bad mixing, poor sonic decisions, etc - but what it's applied to doesn't hit the same way this time.

I also unfortunately feel like I have to talk about the “sampling” on this album. Every time someone that’s not Porter is speaking - I dislike it. The synthetic voice at the end of Russian Roulette is so corny and the meta-commentary is very off-putting. A direct parallel to the end of Mirror - but the execution here is a lot worse, and it doesn’t fit into the overall tone nearly as well. Worse still - Lil Wayne for some unknowable reason is given nearly two minutes of speaking time and it makes for the standout worst song on the album. Even the end of Is There Really No Happiness? - “Just kidding!! teehee xdddd” is just pointless. I almost feel bad for disliking these moments and songs because I hold such deep love for Nurture - but I have to be honest in not enjoying them, even ten listens later.

There are still moments that are emotionally compelling, and they’re absolutely worth praising. Even on songs I don’t like! The end of Kitsune Maison Freestyle is quite touching, and the narrative of Year of the Cup tells a good story. 

In closing, there’s a lot to enjoy here - and I am glad that other people are enjoying it a lot! Overall - my scores for these songs aren't bad, by any means - Porter is still a deeply talented producer and artist. I’ll continue to keep supporting him, and eagerly await the next evolution for his sound. But for me - I’ll be sticking with Nurture for the time being. 

Addendum: 
After seeing it live, unfortunately, my opinions are mostly solidified. Knock Yourself Out, Cheerleader, Perfect Pinterest Garden and Russian Roulette are good songs! The rest are... not as meaningful to me. The Nurture set had me WEEPING - and though I did genuinely wholeheartedly enjoy the SMILE! set (with the exception of Year of the Cup) - it was a different, more casual enjoyment.

Overall, the concert was really great. The fun songs were fun, the visuals, overall aesthetic, and vibe were fantastic. Super great, definitely fun, and having a full band was awesome! However - the fun that I had with this album experience did not remotely compare to the deeply meaningful experience I've had both times seeing Nurture live.
