ANIMÁL
rommulas

Controversial 2hollis collaborator rommulas has released his debut EP - ANIMÁL. Mixing reguetón, rage, and electroclash elements - he delivers a sound that is definitely unique, but lacking polish. Even at a short 16 minutes, it begins to overstay its welcome, as the sound becomes fatiguing. I appreciate the explosive, aggressive sound that's being attempted here, but throughout the tracklist, it's a mixed bag. In this review, I'll touch on where this EP effectively delivers dynamic moments and uses its cross-genre elements, and where the monotonous beats and confusing production choices produce a lackluster sound. 

When this EP succeeds, it is because of rommulas' infectious and consistent energy. No Me Importa !SM is certainly the standout single from this EP, and serves as an explosive opener. The slamming bass, stuttering instrumentation and frenetic melody immediately swarm the listener. It worked especially well as the first track he played live, opening for 2hollis, bringing the crowd's excitement up to 11, instantly. Of course, the Hollis production drastically improves the quality, but it's not the only redeeming quality. I appreciate the exasperated, out-of-breath delivery, with adlibs filling every second where verses aren't being delivered. This noise and chaos is reinforced by the verses - frequently alternating between english and spanish. Though the lyrics are often inelegant, they are clever: "yo tengo dos manos; yo tengo un doble vaso" - a literal *double* entendre that demonstrates intentionality, showing that the track has more to offer than just its manic sound.

Following tracks like Mira !SM attempt to keep up this momentum from the opener, to mixed effect. If I had to pick a word to describe this song, I'd reach for brash, both for better and for worse. On one hand, the energy and confidence is palpable: huge bass hits, hammering percussion, little regard for sounding smooth or elegant. Again, I think the lyricism works well "mi hermano un tigre blanco // tengo manos, peligroso // en la cama, soy un oso" - a nice nod to 2hollis and the eponymous notion of being an ANIMÁL. On the other hand, the dictionary definition including "noisy" and "overbearing" fits this song perfectly, as the initially vibrant-feeling sound quickly becomes fatiguing. At under two minutes, the track feels undeveloped, but I don't think I could tolerate a three-minute version of it. The production boxes itself in - too short to meaningfully develop ideas, but any longer wouldn't be enjoyable to listen to. Although I enjoy the repeated "mira, mira" over the earth-shaking bass slams, it just needs something more to have real staying power.

The EP uses its influences from other genres to mixed effect. One place it works well is Option !SM, featuring and produced by 2hollis. The neo-electroclash production he brings, as well as his verse both improve the song. The car revving sample, ultra-fast percussion, and straightforward melody all work well, providing a good platform for his verse. His voice is great as always, and I like a lot of the lyrics - even if it doesn't hold up against boy or 2. Rommulas' inclusion is... of questionable utility. His verse is more or less directionless, although I get a kick out of "that shit was awesome, woah". It's very short, and for every moment I spend appreciating the delivery of "they say what I did was impossible", I'm spending twice as long bewildered by the choice to include "I'm your father, bitch, I'm your mom". Revising and fleshing out the lyrics would improve the track significantly, and would help match the quality of the other elements. insane !SM is also produced by 2hollis, but doesn't take advantage of the amazing production. The beat is quintessentially electroclash - rapid percussion, airy risers, swirling arpeggiated melodic elements - all providing a good starting point for a highly dynamic, interesting track. Instead, we get "I'm insane now" repeated over a dozen times in a three minute track. It feels as if the beat is hand-holding the vocals, rather than scaffolding them, which is a real disappointment. Across both, there's potential for great electroclash-fusion tracks, but rommulas doesn't fully capitalize on either. 

Unfortunately - the other genre influences are even less enjoyable.  Feeling Like !SM and Rosa !SM sound very similar to me - borrowing the repetitive patterns from reguetón, without bringing the danceability and effortless vibes that are a necessary foil. Feeling Like is too shrill, and the bass pattern gets tiring after fifteen seconds, let alone a full minute. The vocals don't help either: though I like the sped-up flow when he says "bouta park this shit // it's dark as shit // i'm guarding shit", the two-dozen repetitions of "I'm feelin like" with no resolution clobber whatever narrative was being built. I'm usually a fan of choppy vocals, but they're too messy to be catchy here, and do nothing to compliment the instrumental. Rosa has a better foundation - the tone of the melody is a lot better, and the opening "Rommulas!" with the rolled R is actually a nice hook! That said, the vocal tone is a disaster after that. The lyrics are mumbled, half-screamed, and rarely on beat. The beat does not progress whatsoever, and although it actually sounds good when it's the only element for the last 20 seconds, it is a poor foundation for the vocals. Across both tracks - it takes what I dislike about reguetón in highly repetitive melodies, and combines them with ineffective vocals - both in terms of lyrics and delivery. 

There is one song where these influences are balanced well - the closer,  Mami !SM. There's a lot to like here - it feels as if there's finally synergy between the instrumental and the vocals. Where the chaos and rough arrangement of prior tracks tires the listener, this song feels refreshingly coherent. The airy instrumental, rhythmic percussion, and spacey vocals work together quite well - feeling much more sung than screamed. Moreover, there's a real bridge, giving the instrumental space to build and fade into an actual verse where clear vocals give focus to the lyrics. Yes, the lyrical content remains underdeveloped, but it's much less offensive on a track that is fairly pleasant to listen to. As the beat plays out, I'm not disappointed, and shows potential for tracks with real structure moving forward.

At a time when electroclash is having a huge resurgence, both crowning new stars like 2hollis, and returning attention to existing juggernauts Snow Strippers and Crystal Castles, ANIMÁL feels like wasted potential. The visceral intensity works well live, but lacks structure and direction - even at a sixteen minute runtime. rommulas is definitely a name I'll keep paying attention to, but I have to be honest that I hoped for a much better debut EP. I hope that his next release retains the same bombastic disposition, but takes much better advantage of the production, influences, and genres that make him an exciting prospect in the first place.
