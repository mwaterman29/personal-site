my twee monsters
tracey brakes

On my twee monsters - we get an absolutely crushing story of looking in the mirror and not liking what you see, trapped in an unsupportive world, and taking it out on yourself - wrapped in an extremely enjoyable set of tracks. Seriously - this is one of the most well produced, enjoyable to listen to - and it came out of absolutely nowhere. 

A few weeks back, I got 'wand of tens' on my discover weekly. Though I thought it was a good song - it wasn't an exceptional standout. It's a happy part of my liked songs, but it couldn't have possibly clued me in to what I was in store for on this album. 

Recently, one of my best friends sent me this album, and I am very glad he did. This album is absolutely full of highlights. It's hard to praise it enough, as it's not a one-trick pony by any means. 

For me, the obvious standouts are endorphin heist, carbonhead, and especially behave, hollow automaton - all for different reasons. 

endorphin heist opens with a sugary, bubbly instrumental, including glittering chimes and panning pops - contrasted against very dark lyrics that continue the themes of the album well. Quickly, it transitions into a heavy drop which has made it into a super addictive listen. This song sounds like the best parts of super sample-heavy hyperpop, or even daria/glitchcore - but inside of an actually good song. The chopped vocals, abrupt percussion, and that super rich bass make for a super super enjoyable listen.  The alternating between the sugarpop and crushing glitchcore makes this a great sound. It's super tight, too - just over two minutes of some of the most intriguing production I've head in a long time.

carbonhead - This is the closer track, and it's such an exceptional finish to a great album. In form, it reminds me a lot of Figure Eights - the last track on Rot by Tennyson. They're both, in a way, a clean guitar track to ride off into the sunset. Here, though, there isn't the same catharsis, closure, and deep breath at the end. The lyrics are absolutely soulcrushing, and tell an unbelievably compelling story. Genuinely, outside of a song context, the lyrics are excellent poetry. If I started quoting every good line, I'd just be pasting the genius entry - but there are so many good ideas being explored here. Internal identity turmoil, validation of the true self, and friction with a world that sees you as something that is just no longer you.

Particularly, I really love the sound of the lines in the third verse:

Oncе wore mascara to school  
"Almost just blew my cover"  
"Lеt's see those eyes one last time, how come you seem so afraid?"

If you were to play me just those lines, out of context, I'd tell you it's a good song. In a way, this is just a normal song. A very standard percussive pattern, a good guitar tone, and vocals that are kinda interesting. On the other hand - in the context of the album - this song is exceptional. It's so deeply laden with the context of the story it's telling, the production and sound of the album that came before it, that I just can't help but play it over and over. Unbelievable work, really. 

Before discussing what I believe is the best song on this album, I'll discuss the rest of it. 

There are two songs I don't find to be up to the same quality standard established by the rest. On back to sleep, there's a really nice opening synth line, that I was hoping would continue throughout the song. It seemed like it might be a pretty direct synthtronica banger. Instead of this, the drop is just the percussion. Though this is cool - I don't think it results in as good of a song. On what could have been one of the 'bangers', I feel a little let down - especially since the percussion-only drop is executed better on back to sleep.

Second - the second instrumental track, a fish named justice. Though I somewhat enjoy this song, among the rest of the tracks that are of generally very high quality, it's not a standout. Some interesting ideas at play instrumentally, but not a great execution IMO.

The other four tracks are also very strong - I'll discuss them briefly, as they establish and continue the themes of the album well, but have less to point out.  The intro track sets the tone well, and the transition into orphan source is insane! I think they both do well to set the tone for the album - establishing the character of the vocals, the general elements of the sound palette, and the themes that will be present. Particularly, I find her insides meet gods to be really, really enjoyable. The vocals over the matching bass feels super super rich, and the lyrics are excellent to boot.

Viceheart is another compelling listen with some pretty insane lyrics - probably the most direct exploration of the monster-in-the-mirror motif, which is great. Viscera in the drainage? Wild. The imagery is so direct it's unsettling, and that is certainly the point.  

Last is fireside thaumaturgy - another instrumental track, again feels prettty Virtual Riot to me - and that's certainly not a bad thing (see my Lost It review lol). A bit of choppy vocals, clean synths, etc etc.  

Good, enjoyable tracks - which all got high scores - and contribute greatly to the strength of the album.

The strongest song on this album, though, is behave, hollow automaton, which is one of the best songs I've heard all year. This song is an absolutely crushing depiction of self-harm, told through gentle vocals and a simple piano track. I really, usually am not this captivated by lyrics, but the storytelling here is exceptional. An absolute heartbreaker across a couple verses, a few choruses, and an outro. Hopelessness, shame, the inability to escape - and all that just so physical pain can overcome mental pain you can't bear. There's a lot to unload, more than what fits in the form of this review, but this really is, for lack of a better word, absolutely crushing.

Of course - the production continues to be outstanding, which supports the structure of the song. The far-away, pulling bass speaks to a deep tension - summarized best by the line:

Human condition loops endlessly.

To her point - there is no escaping the human condition. But that doesn't mean it's hopeless. There is, to my ears at least, glimmers of hope in this song. Though they're not really present in the lyrics, it does feel present in the sonic choices that are made. I think if this song was trying to tell us that it really is hopeless, it wouldn't sound this way. It'd sound colder, more distant, a little slower. Maybe at the end, we get just the slightest hint - "Her hallowed heart promises to refill again". I think the instrumental sections play to this, as well. They don't sound hopeless, at least to me.  Though I might not have the exact words to describe why - It sounds hopeful. 

In another review, I criticize Gracie Abrams - despite similar subject matter. On I Told You Things, she tells a story of - in her words: 

"Hallucination, shame
Guilt, pain, more pain"

Though we see some of the same ideas here - this is actually coherent - and significantly better for two reasons. For one - it's a lot, lot less direct. The lyrics of the Gracie song are so on-the-nose they feel trite. A story that's so direct about a painful experience doesn't have room for a meandering, curious instrumental. Here, we don't see that. The story is clear - but requires engagement from the listener, and the structure of the song supports a distance from the subject matter that allows the end listener to have a much deeper, slow-burn understanding, instead of beating me over the head with sad lyrics. Secondly, the glimpse of hope that we get at the end helps the tone of the song immensely - and we don't get anything like that on the other track. 

This is a very, very difficult medium to do well, but I think this song is truly exceptional in that regard. I cannot point to a single other song that takes what is probably the heaviest imaginable subject, writes about it with care and tact, and delivers a final product that results in a cathartic and emotional listen. It is a testament to the quality of production, writing, and attention to detail that are present throughout this entire album.

In summary - this song, and album, are excellent. Masterfully produced, deeply compelling, and super enjoyable to listen to. For an album that really came out of nowhere for me, I'm so impressed. I can't wait to see what she makes next!
