My impetus to review this album is the song Time. Let's not waste any (haha) time - and get right to the point - Time !SM is an exceptional track. An absolutely addictive listen that feels like nothing else. This song - and the overall album experience that it exemplifies - is completely singular. It's ethereal, chilling, almost spiritual; yet ultimately deeply compelling and catchy. The sound of this song cuts very deep, but not at all in a bad way. This song is a vignette of a frozen lake in a wintry forest, and the sound of being deeply chilling and enthralling has me coming back time and time again. 

Though there is much praise I can give this song about the atmosphere, storytelling, overall vibe, ultimately, that is all secondary to the fact that it just sounds good. In fact, it's so much better than good. I don't understand what instrument or simulation of one is making the sounds that comprise the melody in this beat, but whatever it is, I want it boiled down and injected directly into my brain - it's so addictive and speaks to the overall production quality of this album. A true dream lineup for guest production: Gud, Whitearmor, Mechatok, and most shocking of all, my favorite artist Yves Tumor. Overall, this album just sounds good. Detached from all the higher order elements - if you removed my ability to understand english and just played this album, I would still deeply enjoy it.

Speaking of deeply enjoying this record, though it's hard to pick a second favorite song, it might be Security! !SM. On one level, Security is a sugary, easy-listening track with a nice melody and glittering sound palette. On another, it's a cutting exploration of looking in the mirror and feeling like you're not enough. The contrast between these things - as well as the delivery of the eponymous "Security!" - has me returning to this song frequently. 

I also really really love Sugar & Diesel !SM. Honestly, for my first dozen listens of this album, I didn't love this song. I didn't think it was bad, but I just didn't latch onto it. Then one time, I just got it. Something about it just hit me the right way some night, and since then, I just love it. I'm not sure I can really explain the reasons, at least in a way that makes this song stand out from the rest of the album. It has all the same things I love - good production, interesting lyricism, great continuation of the album's motifs - but this one is different for me. Maybe I just like the idea of sugar and diesel as a metaphor. Either way, absolutely worth a listen, and super addictive once it just clicks. 

Those are probably my picks for favorites, but the hits on this album are hits for a reason. AAA Powerline !SM, Peroxide !SM, and Calcium !SM are all standouts for a reason. 

AAA Powerline, as an opener, sets the tone and themes of this album very well. The gentle and ethereal instrumental, with the repeating four lines, and theme of paralysis work so well together, and make this song a perfect foundation for the record. Peroxide is justifiably the most popular song - though it does present a more accessible version of the sound and themes of this album - it's not derivative by any means. For me, I actually find the instrumental parts to be the best, that sweeping, swelling production before the vocals come in, and the refrain of the same sound later in the song is what really hooks me in. Finally, Calcium has all the motifs of the album, and uses them all to great success. The repetition throughout the song, the vocal range, and the writing about being broken, fractured, and falling apart - all make this song great. All three of these songs really use the repetition well, and where they vary from the repetition, they excel. "Powerline, I hold the charge" on AAA Powerline, the aforementioned instrumental interruptions of c-c-crushing rocks on Peroxide, and "Ecco2k, I lost all hope" on Calcium. Where you expect the same thing repeated, it just further emphasizes what comes in place of the repeated lines, and that structure makes all three tracks even better. 

Finally, closing out the record is Blue Eyes !SM - a track which I originally did not get. Though this one is less for easy listening, and is a lot more experimental than the rest of the record, it is a necessary track. Understanding the story of what Ecco2k is trying to say with this album - feeling othered, alienated, different - and the otherworldly sound that supports that theme throughout the record - is ultimately brought to a close on Blue Eyes. Of course, the differing eye color serves as synecdoche for a fundamental difference between him and everyone else in his life. Needless to say, given the sharp sound and screaming throughout, at times, this difference is excruciating. 

E is a record that cuts right to the core. Explorations of drug use, belonging, hopeless perfectionism, and a deep struggle. These ideas are explored through great lyricism, ethereal production, and some just plain bangers. Ultimately, I find these ideas, sounds, themes, and songs to be enjoyable and intriguing, and that will have me coming back over, and over, and over.
