The Secret of Us (Deluxe Tracks)
Gracie Abrams
## Cool

Really interesting opening instrumental. I'm not particularly sure what it is, but it sounds both good and intriguing, and I like that it's present at multiple places throughout the song. Here, the vocals are pretty straightforward and follow the piano line directly, so having a consistent throughline that's also a good foil to the other elements adds appreciable depth. I honestly wish there was more like this during the chorus/post-chorus, though I think the vocals matching the bass is quite elegant, and they're both texturally pleasant. Active listening reveals a bit of vocal rasp that matches the reverberation of the string on the bass which is probably an accident, but is quite euphonic. One last little element that I really appreciate - the vocal fade and expansion on 'thought wrong' at around 1:50 is really, really nice.

Otherwise, this song isn't exceptional. The lyrical content is fine - though I'm very uninterested in whoever this is about and how he mistreated Sadie and Sarah and whoever else - it's not too bad. Mainly, my enjoyment of this song is driven by everything in above.

## That's So True

This song is a disaster in more ways than one - I'm convinced Aaron Dessner isn't even trying anymore. It's pretty crazy, given that the last song was not only good, but in large part good because of its composition and small details. 

Starting with the mixing, It's composed quite poorly, and the vocal layering is just a mess. Though the vocals are forward-facing originally, they're quickly replaced by two copies of the vocals with no clear imaging whatsoever. Every time there's an inhale or any vocal fricative, the mix alternates from sibilant and hissing at me to compressed and textureless. This isn't usually an issue for Gracie's vocals either, as they're consistently pretty rich and clear. Maybe my brain just doesn't work, but I swear there are times where it's actually a different track playing in just the left ear. There's a Gracie on my left shoulder and she's doing a worse job at singing the song than the copy in front of me. 

The lyrics are bad and uninteresting, and punctuated by ooh's, uh's and uh-huh's that are so beyond derived, they're insulting. I'm not stupid, but apparently this song (or Aaron Dessner) thinks I am. There's actually some room for interesting discussion here, as I actually like the subject: 

"But I think I like her, she's so fun
Wait, I think I hate her, I'm not that evolved"

Grappling with an ex-lover's now-partner is a pretty interesting idea, and one I'm sure that Gracie's capable of writing interestingly about. Not this time, though. 

I mean, I'd still rather listen to this song than the new greep album or anything by Radiohead but this is as close as it's maybe ever been, and that's not a good thing. 

I'm appalled that this song is as popular as it is - as it only got much worse as I got better headphones. The Monarch MK3s are a truly exceptional IEM, with detail retrieval that's better than anything I've ever heard in my entire life. Unfortunately for this track, they highlighted the many, many flaws.

## I Told You Things

Honestly, this is among Gracie's most interesting instrumentals/beats yet - I really like parts of the instrumental, which I'll get to later. That said, I'm not sure that it actually works well. In my view - partially through a reasoned view, but also partially purely on instinct reaction - I think this song is incoherent. The instrumental, while interesting, doesn't match the lyrical content at all. 

These lyrics are telling a pretty rough story:

"...You built this cage
Lost color in my face, you're fearing I'm insane  
Hallucination, shame, guilt, pain, more pain"

And in the bridge:
"(Don't let them know we're in pain) More pain" x3

But let's compare that against the actual instrumental that's accompanying it, particularly from 1:13-1:20 (and the refrain at 2:40). That doesn't sound like shame, guilt, nor pain to me. To convey those emotions, I'd expect the track to feel colder, slower, stumbling as every note might hurt. I'm not saying I don't like this instrumental - I like it a lot, but the vibe is just not correct with the lyrics. To my ears, that section sounds more like wandering, discovery, or tension about something new. I like when other songs do this too - they're not identical in terms of sound palette, but they function the same: Beautiful World by Tennyson at 1:37, tellmewhatuwant by aldn at 1:55, and like four different Mixed Matches songs - and all of these songs fit that vibe a lot better.

Though that is just a small percentage of the runtime of this song, it is a microcosm of the overall issue that the lyrics, vocals, and instrumental are conceptually and literally dissonant. 

This is an admirable effort, though, and it'd be hypocritical to not praise it, considering I have been begging for instrumental experimentation. There are the bones of a few good songs in this song, and I really hope she continues in this direction - just separating the sad story from this sort of instrumental. 

## Packing It Up

Yo what is HAPPENING with the vocals on this song am I actually losing my mind? Gracie is on BOTH shoulders now and they're OUT OF SYNC? Like at 1:10 it's actually different across both ears. I'm not sure if this is an intentional choice - but if it is, why? I don't understand it. 

Barring that, this song is... pleasant? I actually really like the vignette of a perfect winter morning at the beginning:

The cold side of your pillow, a real break for once  
Good peppermint tea with cool wind on the drive home  
With no traffic for miles, for spring to come

Quite cute, and it's a nice love song, and one that continues motifs from her music generally. Gracie loves to sing and ideate about leaving. The idea of fleeing, escaping, or just plain leaving is a powerful one, and one that continues to appear throughout a lot of her writing. Here, we get the opposite. Staying, enjoying the time at present, and letting go of the serial-leaver urge.

"Don't stop talking to me, maybe stay here forever".

Overall - not bad!

In summary - the deluxe edition is a mixed bag, containing some of the best ideas we've seen in a while as far as instrumentals and explorations go, and the worst sonic choices yet. Thanks Aaron.
