PRESSURE
Julia Wolf

I came to know Julia Wolf through a bit of an odd path. Pearlblade, who's an incredible artist making sample flips that never miss sampled In My Room on 'i like when its dark out'. I listen to everything Pearlblade releases - and that one really stuck out to me. I decided to go hunt down the sample, and then I found In My Room. I was going to review that as a single, because it's a fantastic song, but then I saw that PRESSURE was coming out soon after - so I eagerly awaited its release. Though I didn't know Julia Wolf before - she certainly commands my attention now - as this album is great. On PRESSURE, she delivers an enjoyable set of rock songs in a mix of styles, and is largely successful in each one.

I'll talk about In My Room towards the end of this review, but the other two singles are great too - let's start with Jennifer's Body !SM. The imagery, although fairly on-topic, is clear and engaging. I think the idea of "Jennifer's Body" is on its way to being trite - but it's not yet. It's supported well by the instrumental, particularly during the chorus - the dual strums under "she fits in your life" sound great. If there's anything that I don't like about this song - the delivery at times feels forced - particularly at the beginning. There's an idea of 'singing in cursive', which this song is guilty of at times, which does detract from it. Conversely, the delivery at other times is great: the high register "I know why you want her" is excellent. The other, less catchy, heavier, but just as compelling: Loser !SM. This song rocks pretty hard - I like the heavy production, and frantically delivered vocals, as they work well with the lyrics to paint a compelling picture of obsession. Although I think the notes app phrasing is a bit clunky, the idea of 'like a loser' is quite strong - overall an effective idea, and an enjoyable listen. All three singles are great, and absolutely built my anticipation for this album.

A little later on the album is Limewire !SM, a track I have mixed feelings on. On one hand - it's excellent, as the first 30 seconds are among the best moments on this entire album: insane guitar tone and melody, chilling and distant vibe, and intriguing vocals and lyricism. It continues to build, with the contrast of the heavy strums and ethereal stabs, making for an extremely captivating intro. However - it doesn't really use this momentum well. For one, the vocal modulation is present throughout, which is a confusing choice. It seems like it'd be much better in contrast with a section where the vocals are clear - following the form outlined by the instrumental elements. This problem is compounded with the lack of instrumental progression. Consider a somewhat adjacent song in *permanently dreaming* by the talented TURQUOISEDEATH - it builds in a similar way, but absolutely rips as the song progresses, using the established gravitas well. That does not occur here. I do enjoy this song, but I can't help but see the potential for more. A retooled version of this song could be the best song on this album, so I'm a bit disappointed that it's not. It's still a great song and an enjoyable listen, but it could have been exceptional. 

If anything takes away from this album - it feels as if it's trying a bit too hard to be current. FYP !SM is a weak concept - and though I like the structure of the first verse, as well as the electroclash/brakence-y sound of the first verse and prechorus, I think the rest of the song is... not as good. It sounds decent - but struggles to resolve a bit, the mix is pretty messy and the bottom is a bit muddy. I like the effect on the vocals - but the lyrics are quite bad. "Your For You Page, no it's mine" is clunky phrasing, will not age well, and is corny immediately - let alone how it'll be in a few years. The same is true for "Left a bad yelp review". I can't help but imagine those videos of Anthony Fantano reading bad lyrics - I can just hear him saying it in my head, and that's pretty brutal. I think this is supposed to feel empowered in a way, and it might succeed at that for some listeners, but it really doesn't for me.

The same is true of Girls !SM: I think it shoots itself in the foot by the use of slang with 'You know I'm for the girls, but'. It's easy to get at the same ideas without being trite - which is an unfortunate failure. This song sounds great - as I think the section immediately after the opening chorus is awesome - it just plainly rocks. Additionally, the percussion is quite good - I particularly like how it's used during the pre-chorus. It's not mixed as clearly as I might prefer, but it's definitely enjoyable. Finally - the post-chorus demonstrates great synergy with the instrumental. Overall, a good song, but one that'd be much better if it said what it was trying to in a much more novel way. 

Finally, let's talk about the two best songs on this album - first, the standout single, In My Room !SM. An absolute end-to-end banger, with zero complaints or critiques from me. The acoustic intro keeps itself interesting with nice melody under the 'I miss you all of the time' - and the effective imagery: "I stalk myself on the internet just to see what you'll find". When the electric guitars come in with the percussion, it just rocks. A plainly enjoyable progression that leads into the verse well. The verses also have insanely strong imagery:
"Not asking for much, man, thought maybe you'd call me // I'd slit my own throat just to see if you'd mourn me."
Viscerally gripping lyrics, that effectively capture the extreme nature of obsession. It has all the ingredients of a long stay in the rotation: great lyrics, memorable and engaging composition, and a second life in samples. 

I'd say In My Room would be the clear standout track, if not for You've Lost A Lot of Blood !SM, which is an incredible song, and a perfect closer to this album. I think the beginning of this song is fantastic: the soft, distant vocals, with the two layers of guitar enveloping it makes for a very compelling opening. As the drums start to punch, and the vocals and guitars come into focus, the song becomes even more engaging. Moreover, this song fits my taste perfectly - as the audible whisper and breathiness in her humming over that radiant guitar tone is like a warm hug for my ears. If there's any song on this album that feels designed precisely for me - it's this one. I think the tone and timbre of the layered guitar is also wonderful, it reminds me technicolor by Covet - one of my favorite math rock albums. The drums resolve nicely on this track - better than on others - contributing to both the structure and overall production quality of the track. Finally - the imagery is very strong, I really recommend taking a look at the lyrics for the verses - it recolors the song, certainly in a good way. Although my analysis of this song is straightforward, it really is an incredible track, and one that caps off this album nicely. 

In closing - this is a great album, and a thoroughly enjoyable experience that doesn't overstay its welcome at just 30 minutes. A couple exceptional tracks, many good ones, and a handful that have good ideas or moments despite their stumbling - all in all a balanced and largely successful project from Julia Wolf.
