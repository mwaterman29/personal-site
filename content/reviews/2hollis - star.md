2hollis

On 2 - 2hollis delivered a great set of catchy, quintessential electroclash bangers. On boy, he evolved further, demonstrating continued mastery of catchy and danceable tracks, while at the same time delivering a number of deeply intense and compelling tracks. On star, I was hoping that he'd continue these two paths and push the frontier of modern electroclash even further. Unfortunately - you've seen the score - that is not what happened. Throughout the tracks here, there is a severe lack of energy, intensity, danceability, and replayability - which is a major disappointment. In my opinion, this isn't even within striking distance of his past two albums. Due to its severe downgrade in quality, I have a lot less to say about this album than boy, but I would like to touch on the parts I do enjoy, as well as the lows, and overall conclusion here.

There are songs I like on this album. nerve !SM, chief among them. This is probably the most clear continuation from afraid, the best of the singles from before this album's release, and I appreciate the sound and style of this song. Particularly, I think that the bass-driven melody is enjoyable, and well-placed among the other elements in the song. Similarly, the bridge with the far-away vocals, stripped back horns, and rise back into the melody is very effective. Finally - the touches of iconic 2hollis elements remind me that I actually am a 2hollis fan - the opening '2', the firework sounds, and the lone boy-era synth stab at the end of the song. All-in-all, a well structured, enjoyable, danceable track - praise I wish I could give to more songs on this album.

destroy me !SM is a song I actually like. The bass is pleasant, and the chopped vocals is something I always like. It's structured well, and is an enjoyable listen, for sure. The production is good - bouncy and fun, with a nice bassline, and it gets me bobbing my head. Moreover, I think 'destroy me' is a sufficient motif - an interesting idea, explored just far enough to keep the listener engaged.  However, please note that this is one of the highest rated songs on the entire album. Compare against boy or 2 - and both had drastically more successful forays into catchy tracks. On boy - light was an easy 100/100 from me due to its enjoyable sound, danceable melody, and replayability that led it to a huge number of listens last year - far more than destroy me will get. Even moreso on 2 - all 2s, 2 u, and FORFEIT are all catchier and more enjoyable songs. Let alone poster boy with its perfect production and that awesome vocal shift - drastically more effective than what we're getting here. 

I like dream rain sports !SM as well. Although primarily an instrumental track, it's very well-produced. I really like the punchy percussion against that bubbly top melody, it makes for a nice combination and a pleasant listen.  There's no doubt that Hollis retains his skills as a producer - there's very little on this album that sounds discordant, out of place, or unfinished. That said, I think the overarching ideas on this album are just... worse. Let's compare two songs - all 2s and nice !SM. all 2s is a fantastic song - one I've recently revised the rating up on, due to how much I keep coming back to it. The last minute of the song is more or less a breakdown of the entire track - descending into a beautiful cacophony of staccato chops of the elements, muted vocals overrun with kicks and bass slams, and enjoyable interjections of 'Hey!' and '2.', creating this energetic, highly engaging, awesome track. This breakdown is what I was hungry for on nice, but I just didn't get it. There's still the same diverse palette of synths, vocal mixes, and miscellaneous sound effects that characterize this style, so you would hope for an excellent track. What's particularly frustrating for me, is there's the same interjections of 'hey' like there is on all 2s, but they're drastically less effective here. They have much less contrast from both the vocals and instrumental, making both less enjoyable. On all 2s, the 'hey' cuts right into the expansive, punchy, nearly overwhelming beat, to great effect. On nice, the heys feel unenthused, and they let the beat roll over them, making for a sound that's markedly less engaging than all 2s.

Another thing that I feel like is really missing from this album is a song like promise, from boy. promise pushes the contrast to the limit, vocals constrained and strung out to a whisper, fading gently into silence, before an absolutely ripping, slamming wall of sound - to great effect. Here, there are a bunch of songs that go somewhere - flash !SM, you !SM, tell me !SM - none nearly as effectively. Other songs feel like they ought to go much further - cope !SM and girl !SM as easy standouts to me. It seemed clear to me that Hollis had strong mastery over a sense of internal progression within songs, so it's disappointing to hear songs that feel meandering, apathetic, and anti-climactic.   

Of course, I have to talk about eldest child !SM. In my opinion, this song is a severe misstep. I'm not against artists experimenting - I'm all for it, as I think it's a key driver of artists evolving their sound. This is not evolution - it is regression. I think of this much like the title track from glaive's i care so much that i dont care at all - a departure from the usual sound, a bit slower, a bit emotional, and sonically complete and utter disaster. eldest child is similarly a disaster. The guitar is utterly uninteresting, the lyrics are bad, and there is no compelling production to speak of. The "make your mama and daddy so goddamn proud" is soulless and derived - grasping at straws for some sort of connection which is entirely absent. At least when the lyrics were simple before, they were entertaining. I happily still sing along to "you told me a lie, I told you like three" - I will not be singing along to "you walk a long road, I know you tired". I will not be listening to this song more. I'm glad to be done writing about it, so I can wrap up this review. 

So, how did we get here? Although it's not crystal clear to me - if I had to guess, it'd be that this is a rushed capitalization on his growing popularity. 2 came out in May of 2023, boy in June of 2024 - and so it is undoubtedly preemptive to have another album by April, especially given the singles and multi-leg touring. I can't help but wonder - if we had to wait until August, or December, or even into 2026 - would we have a much different (read: better) album here? There are thousands of middling albums out there, and I'd throw them all away for another 'boy'. Ultimately, you can't force nor rush creative vision - at least not the type that creates incredible albums. Unfortunately, the first three minutes of boy feel more ensouled than this album does in its entirety. 

I don't mean to be disrespectful to an artist I am really a big fan of - but this is clearly a disappointing album. Though there are some moments of quality, and clear indications of talented production, it is by and large unengaging. This isn't the first time that an artist has gone from making a great album to a worse one, and it certainly won't be the last. Only time will tell whether 2hollis will return to the level of quality that turned me into a fan of his in the first place. In the meantime, I'll be listening to poster boy, light, teenage soldier, all 2s, trauma; and almost nothing from star.
