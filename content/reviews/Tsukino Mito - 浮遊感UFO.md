浮遊感UFO
Tsukino Mito

I made strawberry sorbet recently, which, as it always does, has me thinking about Spain. In the summer of 2022, I took a trip to Donostia-San Sebastián, a true paradise in the basque country. In the three weeks I spent there, I fell in love with many things. It was easy to love the food - between the pintxos (small bites, like tapas but better), jamón ibérico, and the ice cream, with restaurants or cafes available absolutely everywhere. I remembered how much I love studying Spanish, and I got much much better during my time there. I learned how much fun it is to travel solo - breaking off from my classmates to find new friends, new places, new experiences on my own.

And, I fell in love with this song.

This review will focus on my experiences listening to this song, rather than the details of it. I won't really be describing the rich, articulated melody that not only draws the listener in, but closes the song out beautifully. I don't intend to talk much about the full-bodied drums that punctuate the melody and reinforce the synergy with the guitars. I don't feel the need to analyze the arrangement of the vocals in and out of the chorus. Tsukino Mito has delivered an immensely enjoyable, high quality track here. But I'm not going to analyze it as I usually might. Instead, I'm just going to tell you a story. 

I travelled to Spain as part of a study abroad program, so we had nice accommodations through the school. As part of these accommodations, we had bikes - which was a key to the city in many ways. It was an easy way to get to the language institute in the morning for classes. It was a license to be out late, not reliant on anything but myself for transport. More than anything, it was the perfect opportunity to be completely in my own world while sightseeing. My commute, was a wonderful ride basically along the whole beach, between the bases of Urgull and Igueldo. It was paradise - a short ride along the beach, warm but not sweltering, breeze always making a tailwind, and just enough uphill to wake you up before class. It was an absolutely wondrous place. And for many of those mornings, this song is what was playing in my ears.

There were many nights where we'd hit the clubs. Although I'm not a fan of reguetón, I have to admit that *¡BE CLUB!*, *Bataplán*, and even that weird jazz club near the language institute (*Dabadaba*??) were all a great time. Loud music, cool people, and ...cold water because I don't drink - but it was still wicked fun. Socializing with the Germans while waiting to get in - learning idioms that only half-translate to English. Dancing to the music while trying (and failing) to have an intelligible conversation in Spanish over the bass. Or - chilling on the outside deck of the club with that girl from Poland as she ripped a cigarette and I watched the moonlight ripple in the waves. These nights felt freeing and deeply enjoyable. At the end of each, I had to make it back to the hotel. Getting back on my bike, I had a short time, still glowing from the excitement, which was largely spent listening to this song. I felt it the perfect way to come down to earth from cloud nine - the guitars helping me ride out the euphoria. 

Finally - there's Pintxo Pote. If you're not familiar, this is an essential cultural experience in the Basque country. When I went it was Thursday nights - the streets absolutely flooded with people, all enjoying an effectively city-wide happy hour, as each bar would offer their combo of a pintxo and a drink, usually for just a few euros. There are only two important rules: one pintxo per bar/restaurant before you hop to the next, and have a good time while you're doing it. I went with probably fifteen or twenty others from the language institute, meandering the streets, enjoying my mosto (pressed grape juice) and small bites, and socializing peacefully. I look back on this experience extremely fondly. Of course - there was a time I had to head back to the hotel. And of course, this song is what I was listening to. 

What I'm getting at is - the fact that this song was the one chosen to complement these experiences is the real praise I have to offer. It was no accident: not an artifact of shuffling, or an unconscious choice. I feel that this song is one of the best songs for 'heading home'; it's a perfect mix of wistfulness and euphoria. It's even better when you're coming home from an experience you know you'll never forget. 

Although those experiences get farther away with every passing year, my memory and my love for this song as part of them are no weaker. Even now, three summers later, and I'm still loving every time I come back to this song. When I make strawberry sorbet, practice my Spanish, or have almost any reminder of my time riding that bike along the bay of Biscay, I can't help but think of this song as well. Yes - it is excellent: well-arranged, wonderful guitar tone, and a thoroughly enjoyable listen throughout. However, it is also inextricably linked with some of the happiest days of my life, so it's quite difficult to separate it out for a rating. Regardless of that - this song is awesome. Next time you're on a nice bike ride, nighttime walk home, or enjoying a strawberry sorbet - give it a try.
