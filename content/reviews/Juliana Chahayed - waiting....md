Juliana Chahayed

Juliana Chahayed, the artist behind one of my favorite songs - [Yellow](https://www.mwaterman.dev/music/Juliana%20Chahayed%20-%20Yellow.md) - returns with another incredible track for the summer. Though she's primarily known for her status as 'the girl who sings through the phone', I think her other work is much better - and that's clearly demonstrated here. waiting... is plainly a wonderful and radiant track, mixing a warm instrumental with gentle vocals to great effect. 

The instrumental character is absolutely incredible and is perfectly arranged. Much like on Yellow - it starts distant, as if its playing through a closed door; in another room. Quickly, after drawing the listener in, this yield to the full instrumental, which I love. The main electronic layer would fit right in among the 2010s hits of MGMT and Neon Indian, characterized by their effective and engaging melodies. Beyond the main melody, the percussion and pulsing countermelody complement the main melody well - I particularly like that the layers are split between the left and right ear. These instrumental layers provide a perfect foundation for her vocals, which suit my taste well: warm, gentle, with audible air. Every element of this song works wonderfully together. 

Moreover - the song has great progression. After the beginning, ending on her “don’t make me sit here waiting…” as it fades into the gentle piano and her wispy repetition of “so alone…”. The subdued piano, fading back into the synthetic chimes makes for a great bridge. The bubbly melody underpins another verse, again ending on the same lyrics, fading again into the piano. At just two minutes - the track is tight, enjoyable, and doesn't come close to overstaying its welcome. The short length makes it easy to loop, and the fade out at the end makes it seamless to listen to this song for hours at a time. 

This song also comes at a good time for it to slot perfectly into my rotation. This summer, I've made a playlist called 'radiance' - to celebrate the upbeat, radiant music of songs like Maude Latour's *Superfruit*, Imogen Heap's *Loose Ends*, or Lunar Vacation's *Mold*. Songs that are perfect for a summer drive, windows down, without a care in the world. This song fits perfectly on that playlist. Yes, the lyrics have some wistfulness, and there's a touch of melancholia in the piano - but I can't help but feel warmed by the fantastic melody and gentle delivery. 

All in all, this is a great track that came at the perfect time for me to enjoy it. It has already accompanied a number of commutes, climbing sessions, and weekend mornings. A great track, and one that I'm excited to see where it ends up in my top 100 for this year!
