This album is fantastic and has REALLY grown on me over time. Though I know Imaginal Disk is the hot discussion - I find myself coming back to this album all the time as well. Over time, and after having seen them live, I think I finally have my thoughts on this album organized and ready to write long-form.

Immediately - the album sets the stage well. Starting with "The End" is a nice conceptual set-up for the themes of the album, but the production is great, too. Immediately transitioning into Mercurial World (with a very clean transition mind you), the album moves you already. Mica's warbling yet strong vocals, big atmospheric sound, and evocative lyrics make for a great true opener. I can feel her walking onto the stage as her vocals come in and are backed by fantastic production. Great track.

Onto Dawning of the Season, the production is still strong - replacing the atmosphere with a catchy beat and a clean chorus. Easy listening, but that doesn't mean it's uninvolved or boring. The synth stabs, layered vocals, and even small textural details still reward active listening, to great effect.

The fantastic track run continues onto Secrets with another seamless transition - into a total trojan horse. The first minute or so of the song is totally unassuming,  but builds to totally explosive production that's just so so catchy. I love the mixed vocals, that addictive synth stab, and the purely electronic feel to the whole sound palette. I just can't not move when this song is on. The end is great, too, flourishing on the same stab with more instrumentation, a horn to your left, a dialup modem floating through space, chatter to your right - an overwhelming harmony in the best possible way.

Finishing the incredible run with another fantastic transition is You Lose! Definitely my favorite song on the album - this song feels like synth pop, perfected. It's so direct, but in no way trite nor derived. It's incredibly catchy - moreso than any song on this album - and I find the 'you aim, you attack, you lose!' just totally irresistible. The lyrics are good to - 'your lips touching mine won't do - only what's left of my pride could lust for a lie'.  Absolutely fantastic track that I just can't get enough of.

Something for 2 is the first track that I think doesn't continue the insane run up until this point. Though I do like the song, I don't love the song. I don't think the percussion+bass intro segment is that compelling, and though I really appreciate the little textural details that are present throughout the song, I just don't find this song to be as compelling in aggregate.

Chaeri I also like a lot. Not a standout originally, but over time, I've really come to appreciate it. Sometimes I just find myself singing it, and for that, it gets some points for certain. 

Halfway is a nice little conceptual marker for the antichronological progression of album, but I actually like how it songs as well. Not a total standout, but not a disappointment either. Mica's vocals are clean and well-layered and so overall I'm not mad at it.

Hysterical Us is a more successful love song than Something For 2 in my opinion - it's pretty groovy. The little instrumental run that functions like a bridge/pre-chorus is REALLY good, and. elevates the rest of the song. I think the song runs a little long, maybe overstays its welcome ever-so-slightly, although the outro is pleasant, so I can't be too mad at it.

Prophecy is another good song. Very evocative of the past in an interesting way - the elegant vocals, opening sound palette, and glittering instrumental elements all make for a coherent vibe which I like. It's not my favorite to listen to, but it's a well executed concept, and that, I respect.

Follow The Leader is gas pack - similarly well executed, but this sound palette selection I am totally in love with. The synthwave drums and bass, blown out vocals, and little vocal chops make for a fantastic listen. I love the little whispers against the vocals that lead into the main verse where the vocal tone is excellent - you took the bait! I think the end is really great as well - letting elements fall away as the electronic, compressed vocals cut over everything for a really great listen.

Domino is another great track. The clean and delicate vocals are an interesting start - almost reminiscent of a Ginseng Strip type beat - that quickly cut into some fairly straightforward instrumentation+vocals. Not for long, though - as you're quickly hit with this huge distorted bass which makes for a fantastic progression. I like the middle of the song as well, clean guitar against her vocals makes for another very pleasant listen. This sets the formula for the rest of the track in a nice way. Maybe it could have gone somewhere else - but it's a great listen either way.

Dreamcatching is a great song - and totally evocative of that sort of dreamscape vibe they're going for. A beautiful vignette of traveling through time and space with someone - as time stretches out. I actually really like how the song finishes as well, the opposing vocals, the increasingly chaotic instrumentation - makes for an interesting listen.

Completing the conceptual journey from end to beginning, the last track is fittingly The Beginning, and wow this track is incredible. In a way, it's very easy listening, and I think intentionally so - easy living sets you free, rediscover simplicity! But the execution is absolutely flawless, and it's a really fantastic closing track. A final wrap-up for this fantastic album. As the instruments fade away, it ends just as you'd expect to - the reverberant whispers that you might hear as you fall into a dream. A little odd because it's my own name though...

Overall, this album is excellent. Their spotify description says it best - synthpop straight from the simulation - a well executed, coherent, and deeply enjoyable take on accessible synthpop. Accessible by no means means boring, though, as there's frequently instrumental and textural decisions that will have you coming back to this album for many many listens. Definitely has grown on me over time, and I hope it continues to do so!
