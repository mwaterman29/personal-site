Like a Kiss

Jane Remover

*This review serves as a corollary to my review of Jane's latest album - Revengeseekerz, which you can read that review [here](https://www.mwaterman.dev/music/Jane%20Remover%20-%20Revengeseekerz.md)*

Jane Remover has, despite her young age, a storied career and healthy discography. From her three main albums, standout EPs and singles, and genre-crushing aliases, it's clear that she is a fundamentally creative and innovative artist. Across all her work - I think this is her best song - and it's not even on spotify! I've been a fan of her work for years, since discovering Teen Week in early 2022. Since then, I've deeply engaged with much of her work: Experimental Skin, Flash in the Pan, movies for guys, Fling, even homeswitcher - all incredible songs, but they're not Like a Kiss. With Revengeseekerz reviewed and this song firmly not on the tracklist, I can't go any longer without talking about it. After seeing it live when she opened for JPEGMAFIA, it's certainly my favorite song of hers. It is simply one of the most loopable, catchy, insanely addictive songs I've ever heard, and it fits my taste exactly. Despite being fairly unknown, I believe to be the perfect demonstration of why I'm a fan of Jane's music: incredible sampling, engaging production, and perfect arrangement that rewards close listening. 

All three of those points - excellence in sampling, production, and arrangement - stand out immediately. This song, like no other, is a masterclass in synergy between the vocals and the instrumental. Moreover, the combination of vocal elements - both her voice and from the sample - is exceptional. In just the first twenty seconds, the pairings are perfect: first with the vocal chop matching the long, buzzing bass pulses. Then, in the left channel, the vocal chops hit with the shorter bass stabs, both punctuating the rhythm well. For the next four bars, Jane herself comes in, humming over the pulsing bass, and glitchy chops of her voice in the right ear, pushing the synergy even more. Finally, the last hits that lead into the verse have neither, and their absence emphasizes their effect. This alone is extremely engaging and detailed - with clear intentionality of the placement in stereo, and the mixing of each element. Although it's difficult to describe in text - especially to precisely identify each element and its placement with just a textual descriptor - the first forty seconds of this song are absolutely enthralling.

The first verse continues to build, as her high pitched asides of 'for a change' and 'all day' glow gently above the rich bass and vocalizations below it. Further into the second half of the verse, with the return of the vocal snippets beneath the extended 'in front of me'/'in front of you', before finally hitting the apex. On the v4 demo recording, this occurs just after the ninety second mark: every other layer falls away for a brief moment of this perfect segment of distant chopped vocals with the percussion, which is the absolute peak of this song. Those four or five seconds of production work have had me coming back to this song for hundreds if not thousands of listens.

Of course, the rest of the chorus is excellent - I find the rhythm of her vocals over the established instrumental pattern to be quite euphonic. Her words seem to waltz along with the beat in paired syllables: 'blow it // in his // face just // like a // kiss' with the last word held as the instrumental flourishes beneath it. This is even clearer with the second instance of the chorus, as the subdued bass makes space for the punctuated, breathy, almost chanting rhythmic component behind every pair of syllables. These small details reward close listening, and after my tenth, hundredth, even thousandth listen - I'm still engaged and enthralled by them. 

Finally - the last instance of the chorus progresses the song further, bringing the piano to the forefront as the vocal layers, glittering arpeggiated chimes, and surrounding elements all work well as a refreshing foil to the earlier part of the song. I appreciate how it emphasizes the vocals, supported by the airy risers, giving them a new feel for the end of the song. Then - the very end, which, despite being abrupt, is quite effective. If anything - it makes it easy to return to the beginning and listen again and again. 

I can understand that to some, this song is just a demo, one that will likely never have its cornerstone sample cleared nor make it to streaming services. Does that mean it doesn't deserve paragraphs picking apart every detail? In my opinion - no. If anything - its unknown status, sparse and cryptic lyrics, and rare live performances make it even more deserving of analysis and discussion. Though it'll never get as many streams as Experimental Skin, bring in new listeners like Fling, or leave the same legacy as homeswitcher, it absolutely deserves a spot in the top ranks of her discography. It is truly a pleasure to have such a creative and wide-ranging artist who - in addition to making all the aforementioned songs - have an even more enjoyable, even more replayable, even better arranged song in Like a Kiss.
