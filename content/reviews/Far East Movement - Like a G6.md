Like a G6
Far East Movement

If you asked me what the best pop song was, I think I might answer with a question. Does Headlock, by Imogen Heap count? What about Magdalena Bay's Image? Maybe even Fall In Love, by Phantogram? All amazing songs, but none are particularly "mainstream pop". If we're talking chart-topping, quintessential, everybody-knows-it pop, then my answer is Like a G6. It may sound like an absurd answer at first - given its lack of lyrical depth; unabashed "club banger" disposition, and indelible link to the 2010s era in which it came out. I understand all of that, and despite that, it's still my pick. Like a G6 is, truly, an amazing song. Between its lightning-in-a-bottle energy, futuristic sound, and undeniable legacy, I wholeheartedly believe that Far East Movement's "Like a G6" is the best chart-topper pop song of all time.

Even among critics, it's hard to deny that this song is plainly quite fun. The energy is infectious, and they know it: "when sober girls around me, they be actin' like they dru-u-unk". Where I might look to other pop-adjacent songs for enveloping a compelling narrative in an accessible structure, this one really is *just* a banger, and it doesn't need to do anything more. The bumping bass, clean claps, and melody (that's really just more bass) all work seamlessly together, and are sure to get any room moving. I don't know if I've ever been to a bad party where this song has played - and that's certainly in part due to the straightforward melody and expansive bassline that fills the soundstage. The lyrics, while similarly direct, are easily defensible. The "three-six" // "G6" pairing is quite euphonic , and I find the repetition of "Like a G6" to be enjoyable, not tiring, even considering the extremely repetitive structure of the track. Considering all these elements - it's no surprise it was an immense hit: it's easy listening, gets people moving, and is a essential track for the parties that make up the vast majority of its playtime. 

Although the structure is straightforward, many aspects of this sound have aged very well. From minute zero, DEV's vocal effect is extremely engaging: staggered layering, audibly airy delivery, and digital post-processing that creates an unforgettable sound. It sounds thin, cold, maybe icy: a perfect fit for "popping bottles in the ice // like a blizzard". Continuing into the chorus, the delivery on "Like a G6" is iconic, and appreciably detailed. The rapid stutter in "li-li-like" sounds like a rolled R, and compliments the chopped, panning "n-n-n-now" well. Moreover - the breath in "six" is a nice foil for the airy high-hats that sound more like compressed air than a real drum. Finally, the rapid claps under the final "Like a G6" of the chorus neatly punctuate the transition from chorus to bridge. Even the "G6" moniker is forward-looking: the first G600 private jets weren't in use until nearly a decade later. Did the Far East Movement consider any of these details and their consequences when making the song? Honestly, I don't know. But for a song about getting messily drunk, I find it refreshing that the composition is actually good. It's one thing to sound messy - it's another thing entirely to create this sound intentionally with structure. Although they don't have much of a legacy beyond this song, I believe these elements - matching vocals to the airy top-end, chopped vocals, punctuating percussion - continue to work effectively in modern pop songs. To have this nailed in 2010 is impressive, and it supports the decade-plus of cultural relevance and continued millions of streams.

Considering the following fifteen years, I think there is a material legacy for "Like a G6". The obvious touch point is Charli XCX's BRAT, and the club-banger tracks within. Consider Von Dutch - a standout track, brat-summer staple, easily a 10/10 song for many critics, myself included. There's a certain astringency to the track - the digital, processed vocals, sharp synth risers, even the slimy, off-chartreuse of the cover - unapologetic, eccentric, and in my opinion, very similar to "Like a G6". This is by no means aping - BRAT's 360, B2b, Sympathy is a knife and so on all innovate on the "club classics" sound effectively. That said, I think Like a G6 deserves its flowers for being a cornerstone of the sound being innovated upon. BRAT was a watershed moment, truly definitional for an entire summer of pop, and to be honest, I don't know if it'd be exactly the same without "Like a G6". To ascribe all the credit would be absurd, but in my view, the shameless 2AM-rally sound of Like a G6 meaningfully contributes to this strand of BRAT's DNA. For that, it deserves praise. 

From its position on the top of the charts, to the minute details of the chorus, to its lasting legacy, Like a G6's impact is hard to overstate. Though club music has never been the highest art form, it very well might be the highest surface area. Keeping this in mind, I am happy to give Like a G6 a spot in the canon. What may initially seem like an indefensible choice, upon close examination, reveals some real redeeming qualities. Whether you agree or not, you're likely to keep hearing the song, as its still a staple for any party-aux playlist that wants to please the attendees. For me, I'll keep listening to it, keep playing it at the parties I host, and keep searching for its influence in the pop that comes out this half of the decade.
