we had good times together, don't forget that
Sewerslvt

I'm torn on this rating. In a patreon post a couple months before this album's release, the artist said "If I have any request it is that people do not “review” this specific album." - irrespective of the review being praise or criticism. Nearly three years since then, and I, as a music critic, have to grapple with my own enjoyment of this album and desire to share that enjoyment, against the artist's wishes.

Though I understand the request, it is also anyone's right not to heed it. I don't think it's reasonable to put out art into the world like this and have it be removed from the conversation, especially given its status as part of the greater genre, and as the capstone to the Sewerslvt project as a whole. I think, had Jvne not returned, I may have respected the request. Given their return to music under a new alias, I think it is fair to discuss this album.

My primary motivator for wanting to give this album a review is that I really believe it is exceptional. I think it's very strong throughout, but that it has multiple candidates for best song of all time on it, which is an extremely, extremely short list. Ultimately though, it's not just the highlights of this album that drive its near-pinnacle score - it is the central sense of ethereal drive that appears in every song. I feel as if there is a unified, underlying quality of composition that I find super engaging. Almost always, there's multiple layers of airy synths, fast-paced percussion, and cross-cutting melodies - but not ever haphazardly. Sure, there are times where the sound palette is abrasive, and it feels as if the album is winning a war of attrition with your senses. However - when it wins, when you lay down and submit to the sound - it unlocks a feeling and engagement with the music that I only get here. Though you lay down, the album pulls you forward, until the end of the final track.

It feels meditative in a way - as you hear every layer, every kick and snare, every synth - there's no space to be thinking about work, or what you're going to have for dinner, or what you have to get done this weekend. Despite the moments that are sharp, discordant, seemingly a cacophony of sounds, there is a fundamental peace that occurs here. I don't get that feeling from any other album. There are albums I enjoy more than this, ones that I think are composed better, have catchier songs, lyrics that make me cry, songs I can't stop looping - and so on. With all of that said - no album delivers me the same feeling as this one does. For that, I love it deeply.

Returning to the discussion on best song candidates, all the joy in life was gone once you left !SM is absolutely colossal, and is in many ways the most perfect, exemplary, stand-out track of this entire genre. Listen to this at night on a pair of good headphones and I swear it will change your life. If you don't get it, keep listening to it until you do. Though the song is fantastic throughout the runtime, it becomes life-changing at around 2:45. The melody cuts right to your core and doesn't let up for minutes. It's so viscerally gripping, and richly rewards active listening.

Similarly incredible is inertia status !SM, which is probably my favorite song on the album as far as plain listening goes, and is constantly fighting with the Jackie remix for favorite overall Sewerslvt song. This song is just enthralling, as the massive cymbal crashes, main driving melody, and simulated vocals harmonize to make for an exceptional listen. inertia status also starts the incredible 5-track run at the end of the album, succeeded by die alone !SM. As the melody opens alone - those eight chilling notes, punctuated by static and crackling. As the atmospheric elements grow and fill the soundstage, the percussion punches through and demonstrates why this song is so, so good. It does run a tiny bit long for my taste, and though the opening is genuinely exceptional, the abrasion at the end does drag on past its welcome.

The 5-track run is immediately redeemed by sick, twisted, demented, which has really grown on me over time. In a way, this feels like a future bass song, repainted. Instead of a clean drop, we get this serrated melody that just sounds incredible, plainly. Continuing onto her, which I imagine to be a controversial track. The TTS vocals, lyrical content, and punchy percussion and bass - for me, this all works, but I could easily see how it couldn't. 

As the album comes to a close, we are left with goodbye !SM. There are times when I think goodbye is the best song, ever. I will often talk about songs having to justify their length, and that many songs drag on too long, overstay their welcome, get stale, etc. Here, though, we get a microcosm of the entire vibe of the album, that justifies every second of the seventeen minutes it takes up. It feels as if there are four or five songs in one here, and they're all incredible. Though there are no lyrics, really, I still feel as if I understand what this song is saying to me. You could call it the five stages of grief, a story of love and loss, or just an incredible track. All the same - it exemplifies everything that makes this album exceptional. The masterful percussion, the cultivated atmosphere, the cutting, glittering, dazzling synths, and the heartrending ending. As I said earlier - this album pulls you forward, until the end of the final track. As we come to that ending, as the percussion quiets down, and we're left with just a fragment of a voicemail, it ends. I know I haven't talked much about the real subject matter here. I'm not sure I have the right words or personal perspective needed to do so with tact and decorum. What I am sure of, though, is that for any listener paying the proper respect and attention to this album will understand what it's trying to say. 

This album, on first look, seems inaccessible, hard to pick up, deeply complex, and impossible to recommend to people. Despite all of that, it is also among the most rewarding listening experiences that exist. The atmosphere is truly singular, and in a tracklist that appears thorny and gnarled hides some of the best songs of all time. In the right context, at the right time, with the right pair of headphones, I believe there is a journey for everyone to be had here. I don't think mine is done yet - as I hope to continue enjoying this album and all it has to offer for years to come. Though I know I may have gone against the artist's wishes by writing this review, I couldn't let my deep appreciation for this album go unsaid - and I hope that I have done right by Jvne in spite of that.

Rest In Peace, Angel.
