I Love My Computer
Ninajirachi

Ninajirachi is a name I've loosely known for a while - but didn't pay nearly enough attention to before. I found "Undo U" in late 2023, and despite loving the song - I didn't recognize that I should listen to more from the artist who made it. Just before this album's release, I got Infohazard's music video recommended on Youtube, and finally all the pieces began to click. I'm grateful that they did, as this album is absolutely amazing. Though little of the early 2010s, Monstercat-and-NCS-era dubstep holds up, it did plant the seeds for my enjoyment of rich bass, choppy vocals, and bright electronic lead melodies. Ninajirachi's "I Love My Computer" descends from this early era EDM, refining the sound with rich bass, clear vocals, and seamless transitions, making for an excellent end-to-end listening experience. 

From the very beginning of this album, it's clear that Nina has a great understanding of how to tune and mix a bassline. London Song !SM, the opening track, clearly demonstrates this. It opens on muddled claps over an attenuated bassline, giving space for the clear, forward vocals. As the vocals begin to stutter, the percussion builds up - leading into the "do you want to... listen to it?" - a fitting lead into the drop. The bass opens up, going from sounding muted to this clear, ripping tone which I really enjoy. When the vocals come back in, the bass is brought down, supported by an airy second layer. In the first couple minutes, the arrangement is incredible: marrying diverse low-ends, punchy percussion, vocal chops, and synth lead for a great opening track. This album sounds even better with 'fun', U-shaped tuning, my U4s bring these elements to another level, pushing the rumble of the bass and brightness of the top-end to make this song absolutely shine. The same is true on Fuck My Computer !SM - the texture of the bass is engaging, serving as a solid foundation for the lyrics. I particularly appreciate the contrast between the clean bass and the computer's "lyrics", made up of distorted beeps, buzzes, and tones; the textural differences keep the chorus very engaging, despite the slow pacing of the lyrics. Of course, this song also has an amazing drop, as almost every song on this album does. Again, the bass returns to rip, rumble, and slam, building this on-theme digital tone. It's evocative of hard drives spinning, fans whirring, and dial-up buzzing - exactly fitting this album's subject matter. Though I've just highlighted a couple, the overall sound of this album - particularly in the low end - is amazing.

Building on the instrumental foundation established by rich bass and punchy percussion, Nina's vocals consistently shine through on this album. I have, for over a decade, been in love with this archetype of EDM: synth-heavy instrumentals with clear, bright vocals on top. In the early 2010s, it was the likes of Veela, Dankya Nadeau and Laura Brehm - and now it's Ninajirachi. For example, on iPod Touch !SM, her vocals are really the cornerstone of the song. Easy to sing along to, upbeat, and beautifully contrasts against the heavy bass. Moreover - I really appreciate how well her vocals match the rhythm of the instrumental - the pacing, where the syllables land, even the minute detail of how she says "64-bus home" - it's fantastic. Beyond her sung lyrics, the vocal chops serve a key role here: retaining vocal presence, but switching the role from lyricism to a melodic or percussive focus, as each cut fills the space of a synth lead or quick kick. Super enjoyable to listen to, and a great addition to bridge between verses. The same is true for one of my favorite songs on this album, It's You !SM. Daine's feature is very strong: the wistful lyrics complement her vocal tone extremely effectively. Even after dozens of listens, this song still gets me moving and singing along: "When I think about it I ... cry" with the layered vocals and banging instrumental - plainly fantastic. Even better is the chopped chorus - I adore that you can hear that it's the chorus, hearing fragments of "Pick me up" before rising back into the "It's really you". Even the early "chopped" vocals - extending the syllables "feel better about it" and "that kinda magic" to match the beat is fantastic. All these details come together to make one of the best EDM songs I've heard in years, and one I hope to be singing along to for years to come.

Beyond the details of individual songs, the transitions between them are masterful. Originally, I wasn't going to include a rating for ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ !SM, as I almost never review interludes. However - it contains a frictionless transition into the next track, All I Am !SM. One thing I especially love about live performances is the transitions between songs: extended intros, live mixes, or little segments of the beats before really dropping into the track. The end of the interlude fits this perfectly - you get just a taste of the sound palette of All I Am before the "All I am, all I can // All I need is where I am" begins to echo. It's so compelling - it makes me deeply excited to hear All I Am from just the small elements of it at the end of the previous track. On its own, All I Am is really effective with a super clean build-into-drop. With the extra hype coming out of the previous song, it's even better. This effect is doubly strong on CSIRAC !SM, and I primarily enjoy it for the end. On its own, I'd say the song is a bit too percussion-focused, it reminds me of tracey brakes' "back to sleep". Although the percussion is cool, I can't help but feel that it'd be improved by a main melody. However - towards the end of the song, new elements come in, these glittering, spacey tones, building the start of the transition. The bells come closer and closer, leading absolutely perfectly into the start of Delete !SM, one of the best songs I've heard all year. The instrumental is incredible - the punchy leads, radiant arpeggiated melody, and absolutely colossal drop - flawless from end-to-end. On top of this instrumental is really a great and relatable story - analyzing the "modern mega-digital meta mating ritual". I love the verses - describing posting an instagram story for everyone to see, but thinking about just one person in particular when you post it - even picking a song that they like. A prime reflection on this weird, digital courtship - "I only posted it so you would see it". I enjoy every aspect of this song, and I am truly electrified by the transition into it. It's clear this album was attentively tuned for listening front-to-back, and that comes through in spades, a clear testament to the musicianship on display here.

If the transitions in a studio-album context are a 10/10, then they'd have to be a 20/10 live - Nina is an incredible DJ and performer. On September 25th of 2025, I saw her at the Middle East Downstairs in Boston - a tight, low-ceilings, sweaty basement. It was one of the best concerts I've ever been to. Her set was unbelievable, and the crowd was an ideal audience - dancing, jumping around, singing along to basically every song she played. The combination of her stage presence, the packed venue, and the quality of this album electrifying the crowd, the energy in that room was literally unmatched. Even a month later, I keep re-watching videos and reflecting on what an insane experience it was. Each element I highlighted felt even stronger live: the physical presence of the bass, groove of the chopped vocals, and seamless transitions achieved by her skills on a Pioneer Opus. It is truly a privilege to have seen her live, especially given that she hails from halfway across the globe. I'll be counting the days until she comes back; I can only hope to find another show with the same energy, crowd, and perfect setlist.

On the whole, I Love My Computer is quintessentially enjoyable EDM: electronic dance music - exemplifying every word. The sound palette is fundamentally digital, from the mouse clicks in place of high hats, to the thematic elements of loving your computer, to the electronic synths and basslines. It certainly makes me want to dance, and I had the pleasure of doing so when I saw her live last month. Finally - this is some real good music, with clear attention paid to the mixing, mastering, transitions, and overall experience being greater than the sum of its parts. It's easy to imagine a world where EDM fizzled out after dubstep lost its luster, where Porter Robinson stopped after Spitfire, and where the sounds that influenced this album's creation were instead the end of the road. We are lucky to instead live in a world where artists like Ninajirachi continue to innovate and refine this sound with albums like I Love My Computer.
