On October 12th, 2023, I saw Maude Latour in Boston, and praised her for being a magnetic and charming performer with a wonderful voice and stage presence. On March 18th, 2025, I saw her again, this time for the release of her first album, Sugar Water. I'm happy to say that she was every bit as charming, magnetic, and engaging as the first time - but this time with even more stage presence and production value! The tour was for her debut album - Sugar Water - a deeply enjoyable electro-pop project that's perfect as a 'sound of the summer' album. With a full year of listening to it solidifying my opinions, I feel that it's the right time to return and review it. This review, of course, will discuss Sugar Water. More than that though, it'll be another love letter to an incredible performance from a wonderful artist who undoubtedly loves her fans. 

This summer, I made a playlist called 'radiance' - songs to sing along to in the summer, songs that exude a bright, radiant energy. Officially Mine !SM, the opening track, is a perfect example of this - and it's probably my favorite on the album. Engaging, fun, energetic, care-free lyrics that make up an enjoyable pop song. I think of this the same way as Lunch from the Twin Flame EP - easy listening, sweet lyrics, and perfect for summer. I really love the chorus of this song - "I made a wish last night, you were officially mine" - it's just lovely. Beyond the lyrics, this song is still great - punchy, reverberant bass, upbeat percussion, and that rapid melody all support her vocals well. I particularly like the "(super sweet)" in the chorus as the whole instrumental drops out - bit of a Spikes thing going on, and it perfectly punctuates what is an otherwise super energetic track. This radiant energy also comes through on Summer of Love !SM - a simple and eponymously summery track. Though it might not be the most moving song I've ever heard, nor does it have the most compelling lyricism, it is plainly warm and enjoyable. The rapid claps and clacking drumsticks scaffold the rhythm of her vocals well, making it easy to nod along with the beat. Towards the end, I really like the vocal chops with the bending second vocal layer. Clean pop that makes for pleasant, easy listening. Finally, on Comedown !SM, towards the end of the chorus, there's another vignette of a young, carefree summer. With the lines "Oh oh, summertime air // we were sixteen, we would never get carded" - she delivers a punchy picture of youth in the summer. The delivery really sells it well, and I thoroughly enjoy the track. Across all these songs, there's a unifying characteristic of exuberant summer warmth that I find extremely engaging.

Beyond this album feeling bright and summery, I also can't help but find Maude herself to be extremely charming. This is doubly true live, but even on the album, there are many moments that work well to show her personality. For example - on Too Slow !SM, the storytelling is a bit camp, but also easy to enjoy. The whole song exudes a cool confidence: "everybody has so much to say about the party they don't go to". There's a bit of 'getting away with it' as well - "up under the bleachers // where the band kids kiss the football team and I keep kissing cheerleaders". A bit tongue-in-cheek and very endearing as a listener. For some, I'm sure it'd be easy to write off as corny, but for me, I think it's really quite an enjoyable and charming song. I feel similarly about Cosmic Superstar Girl !SM - "I had a vision of the North Star // She picked me up in her parents car". Though for many, the imagery might feel trite, I disagree. I find the song to be rich with vignettes that are cute, not corny - discussing silent glances as trains part, long drives down to the cape, and an undeniable truth that some nights will change your whole life without you even knowing it. These images, though wistful in their original context, offer insight into her life and experiences - making it easy for the audience to form an emotional connection with this track. Across both these songs, I find that Maude's personality shines through well, and that is absolutely a positive quality. 

 Changing gears, I'd like to dive into the namesake Sugar Water !SM, I initially have mixed feelings. The pacing of the pre-chorus into the chorus leaves a bit to be desired, and although I like the variety of the instrumental elements, they're not fully coherent. I love the sound of the second verse, but the chorus after the fact drags on a bit. All that being said - the track is completely redeemed, ending on a total high point. Coming off the breakdown into the resolution of the track is incredible. Her high register vocals, and the delivery of "I'm crushed once again, I wish you were in my head" is amazing, sticking the landing on an otherwise meandering track. The idea of 'sugar water' is executed much better on, of all tracks, the interlude - 7 !SM. Though I usually omit interludes and skits from track ratings, this is a justified exception for an incredible song. This track opens on a wistful, gentle reflection on the past. She's looking in the rear-view, feeling bittersweet: "Seven years really go by // I could hear that song anywhere // And it would make me cry". This emotion is perfectly supported by the somber piano, distant strings, and the layering on her vocals - all harmonizing for a very moving intro. With a far-off refrain from 'Sugar Water', the tension is held for just a bit longer... until that ripping drum fill. The huge cymbals, shining melody, and now-or-never lyrics all come together for an incredible payoff. It perfectly captures seeing someone for the last time, and choosing to end on a high note. I could copy the whole second verse here, but it's summed up well by the ending: 'No, I don't wanna die // But I think we might // So I'll just love you harder'. Incredible work. Though it is 'just the interlude' - I firmly believe this to be the best song on the album. I find the progression and storytelling to be deeply moving, and I love how the song progresses from small and gentle to colossal and explosive. In the context of the album, it also plays an important role. Sonically, it serves as a perfect foil to the bright, upbeat pop that comes earlier in the track list. More than that, though, it perfectly conveys the point of the name 'Sugar Water'. Love, when you're in it, can be as sweet and straightforward as sugar water.

While the slower opening of '7' is highly effective, the other slower parts of the album are a bit of a mixed bag. Whirlpool !SM is largely successful, but in my opinion, doesn't get all the way there. The warping, swirling instrumental is evocative of a whirlpool, but drags on a bit. I think the stripped back instrumentation also puts unneeded on the percussion, which is boringly sparse and thin. On the other hand, I like a lot of the details - like the layered interjections of  "I whisper..." and "Come closer!" - they punctuate the beat well. Moreover, the heavier sections of blown-out vocals and heavy bass work well, ending on the 'now my head is spinning, but I love it in the whirlpool'. The contrast between these two sonic modes work well, and they come together well for the concluding breakdown. All in all, it's an engaging and fairly well-structured song, but not perfect. The closing track Bloom !SM is very similar, for better and for worse. Though I like the heavy bass hits and vocal layers, the same problems are present. The beginning of the song struggles with pacing, and the structure is not interesting enough - it feels like it drags on a bit. Not a bad closer, but in my opinion, it doesn't stick the landing. This feels like a weaker version of I am not the sun - experimenting with complementary vocal layers and heavier instrumentation - but to much less success here.  I'm all for experimentation, but I think the slower moments are markedly less effective than the brighter, faster moments earlier in the album. 

Although yes, there are moments on this album that are ineffective, I can't help but love it. More than anything else, there is a vibrant love for life and playing music for her fans that's plainly infectious. Over a year out from release, it still puts a smile on my face every time I come back on this album. In a time where music often feels cold, contrived, commercial, the earnest and energetic warmth of Maude's music is a refreshing contrast. From first listen to hearing it live, it is abundantly clear that Maude loves her life and her fans. To end this review, I offer just a short vignette of seeing her live. The encore is concluding, an ultra-energetic performance of Cursed Romantics.  As the drums and guitar were winding down, she thanked us, the audience - saying 'thank you for letting me be the soundtrack to a little part of your life'. To that, I say: 

You're welcome, Maude, it's been a pleasure.
