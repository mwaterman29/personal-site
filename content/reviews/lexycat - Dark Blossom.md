Dark Blossom
lexycat

Dark Blossom is an album that is mindfloodingly intense, deeply digital, at times even noisy and chaotic. Through the noise, though, there is a sense of real beauty in many moments on this album. This is the fifth real release from young Australian producer Lexycat - who is drastically under-appreciated despite making consistently fascinating music. If there is any quality I would ascribe to her music, it's digital. This is unmistakably music of the internet age - deep sampling work, a variety of production techniques, and a frequent hopped-up chaos that makes for both overwhelming soundscapes and rich active listening experiences. Look at the sample list on her bandcamp - it's a wild array of video game soundtracks, all-time fantastic tracks, modern hyperpop, and even her own past releases. Through all of that, we get Dark Blossom, a variety of tracks ranging from leaning heavily towards digicore and sample flips, or fully embracing the breakcore and DnB elements. In this review, I'll explore how Dark Blossom creates beautiful moments through both chaotic digital elements and straightforward production, touching on my favorite tracks to show how this album is so innovative.
### Opening Tracks
For such a varied collection of tracks - I think they're better analyzed individually, rather than touching on common themes between them. Though I've been leaning anachronistic in my reviews recently, the opening few tracks are all great, and I'll discuss them each in turn.

Darklove !SM is such a perfect opener. I often praise the opening tracks of albums that I like for setting the tone well, and that's no different here. Honestly, the closest touchpoint I have is Lifelike, the opening track on Nurture. A pleasant, primarily 'instrumental' track (though that term might lose some meaning in a context like this), that establishes a tonal palette and cadence for the listener to expect. Especially true at the end of the song - as the crushing bass and overcooked ambiance prepares the listener for intense moments to come. A great track, and a great opener. 

While Darklove ends abruptly, Moonscythe !SM opens cleanly, as it borrows from one of my favorite tracks of all time, Headlock by Imogen Heap. This song is another branch on the large and healthy tree that descends from Headlock, and is certainly an interesting one. The off-kilter percussion and weird panning bass complimenting the slower elements from Headlock all make for a fascinating listen. Then, it all falls away. As the elements fade, we're left with just the sound of water, which transitions into this wonderful piano line. It plays for a bit, and then that fades too, ultimately ending again on the gentle river or babbling brook. This song is so interesting - if you weren't drawn in before, you certainly are now.

The first two tracks are great, but I think the major standout for me is Chrysalis !SM. I'm highly partial towards this exact type of music, but even putting my predilections aside, I think this song is really excellent. The opening is very compelling - sounds of wind gusting, and distant chimes or bells. Continuing, the melody drifts in, enveloping you in an atmosphere that's tranquil and quiet. This tranquility is immediately crushed as the instrumental rises in a powerful way, leading the listener through the melodic progression. The percussion comes in and immediately cements this song as a strong addition to my ever-growing library of atmospheric breakcore. I like how the song progresses, too, as the rapid percussion fades away for strings and a forward-placed synth, with the chimes panning from side to side, which makes for a beautiful section leading into the second half of the track. There are moments here and there where I find the percussion to be a little over-mixed, or the snares to be a little sibilant, but generally, I really like the intensity of the second half, and the resolution of the track is quite pleasant as well.
### Mid-album Progression
Through the rest of the record, Lexycat continues to deliver tastes of digital hardcore, atmospheric DnB, and even digi/dariacore with the layering from the likes of Jane Remover, Bladee, and past lexycat releases. All of these efforts are supported well by her vivid and well-curated sample work, which is an art form all its own.

Dark Star !SM combines heavy guitars, layered vocals, and arpeggiated synths - all coming together for a great listen. Undoubtedly complex - it takes a close ear to sift through the many layers here. With samples from Spiritbox, Jane Remover, and PSYQUI, the composition can be overwhelming at first. From the chaos, though, emerges a whole much greater than the sum of its parts - as the full synergy between all the parts is really fantastic. If not for the ending, which I find a bit incoherent, this would be an easy 100 for me.

Building on the complexity of Dark Star is Angelstar !SM, which is the best song on the whole album. Structurally fascinating, super intense, and incredibly well composed. The completely unassuming introduction that evokes this abstract nostalgia through its compressed melody and gentle tone. As that progresses, it starts to build, getting a bit more compressed, this ultradigital percussion comes through, and then...

"Her time was up. But she refused to die"

Absolutely crushing. This massive drop, chopped and looped abruptly, tension building, as if the song can barely get it out - it's so compelling. It continues to build and build, as the punchy percussion, vocals, and synths all descend into chaos. Finally, the song comes all together with this absolutely ripping synth, huge kicks, and vocal countermelody around the three minute mark and it just washes over the listener in this 30 second period of an incredible peak on the song. Though it's a bit hard to follow on first listen, the high points on this song are really exceptional. 

### Beautiful Closers

This album finishes strong - with two excellent tracks, Back Together and Moonlight Requiem.

Back Together (millie's song) !SM is an excellent track, in spite of its relative simplicity to the rest of the album. Glittering chimes, a straightforward melody, and warm vocals all come together well. The lyrics are excellent, too, and tell a compelling story. Wishing to be someone else - irrespective of the reason - is a complex subject, handled with tact in a compelling way here: "I know my body isn't everything it should be // I know that my face is kind of covered in scars // I know that I can't be the girl of your dreams". The contrast between the upbeat sound and the heavy-handed subject makes for a great song. 

Following the introspective Back Together is the last track, Moonlit Requiem !SM, somehow both feels out of place and perfectly fitting. It lacks any samples, weird synths, or off-the-wall percussion. It doesn't feel viscerally digital, dazingly hyper, nor comprised of a million elements. If anything - it's the opposite: analog, slow, and simple. However, from just this piano, and the context of the album before it, emerges a beautiful track. Straightforward, but aptly atmospheric. Simple, but beautiful. A portrait of a pianist in the evening, playing you an eponymously moonlit composition. This song is a true testament to lexycat's versatility - able to compose a beautifully simple piano track on the same album as some of the most whirlwind digicore I've ever heard. 

Overall, this Dark Blossom is great. Certainly abrasive, overwhelming, or confusing at times, but just as many times, it's beautiful, compelling, and well-composed. For the chronically-online audience it's intended for, there's gems all throughout. From hypermodern sample mashups to deeply compelling synthetic melodies - lexycat delivers on Dark Blossom. At times, it's rough around the edges, lacking refinement, or missing a crystal-clear direction. Despite that - across the tracks here are some exceptional moments, and admirable efforts where it falls short. Lexycat is undoubtedly talented for someone so young, and continues to push these nascent genres forwards. With each album, she improves - picking from a wider variety of samples, production techniques, and storylines - ultimately resulting in a wonderful collection of tracks. I'm very excited to hear her next release - with whatever insane samples, mind-melding synths, and punchy production it's sure to offer.
