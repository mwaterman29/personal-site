A Great Chaos (Deluxe)
Ken Carson

This album is a lot of fun to listen to. There's a handful of places where it's not put together well, or the sound overstays its welcome - but that's generally outweighed by excellent production, fun songs, and occasional extreme bangers.

The album falls short in a few places - particularly on It's Over, and Singapore. The beat on It's Over is a little grating, I'm not a fan of the vocal intonation, and I don't think it really has much to offer. I like when songs are tight but the minute and a half isn't really used well. Singapore is a disappointing lone feature, and though it's not that bad, it's not that good either. Thankfully, lone redeems himself well on Paranoid. 

In other places, the album really shines. Both Paranoid and Pots demonstrate the production quality extremely well - both good songs with insane beats, and I particularly appreciate that he lets the beat talk at the end. Very reminiscent of something like Waster - incredible beat that gets the last bit of the song to end on a high note. 

Nightcore is an insanely fun song. Of course - I love the beat - Neilaworld always delivers - but the song's a lot more than that. There's something very funny and charming about the "hi i'm ken carson :) " vibe of the song. Surprisingly catchy and replayable too, and always brings a smile to my face when it comes on. This album is just fun. Even on songs that are just above middling - like Hardcore - the song's a bit goofy, but the beat is just so hard. And there's quotables everywhere - "I'm like Ferb - I don't say shit". Though you might critique this album for being stupid, not insightful, immature - whatever - at very least, it doesn't claim to not be, and for that, I respect it. This album knows what it is, and stays in its lane to great effect. 

There's also a couple songs here that I think deserve particular praise - overseas and i need u. overseas is an absolutely ridiculous beat - one of the best of 2024, and is a killer closer to the album. He kills the beat, and he knows it. The unbridled confidence, skull-crushing bass, compelling vibes make for one of Ken Carson's best songs to date. Especially as the bass disappears for the second bridge, dropping back in right after the 'yeah, I'm overseas' - banger.

Speaking of excellent beats - i need u - probably my favorite Ken Carson song, period. The beat is addictive, the bass is incredible, the accessible and enjoyable lyrics - easy 10 from me, to be honest. The song is too enjoyable to not give it a really high score. It's perfectly exemplary about what is appealing about this type of music: loud bass, fantastic production, ignorant but charming lyrics, and flexing harder than you ever could hope to. Also - the misheard lyric of 'I'm in this *bed* with Destroy Lonely is too comical to pass up. The idea of two members of the mysterious rap collective Opium who both maintain a visage of posting up with two hoes, a pint of wock, and a kel-tec being snuggled up in bed together is just insane comedy.

Yes, this album is ignorant, overconfident, and at times just plain annoying. Much more frequently, though, it's catchy, well-produced, and simply fun to listen to.
