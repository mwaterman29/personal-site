Nurture
Porter Robinson

After hearing much of this album again during the 2024 SMILE! / 'career-spanning setlist' tour, I've come to realize the deep emotional impact that this album had on my life. This album came out at a time where life was rough for everyone, me included. As a student heading moving into a dorm with no roommates and pretty draconian covid policies, it was highly isolating. I was lucky to have many friends I could keep up with virtually, but the isolation was still pretty brutal. 

As I've grown, recovered, and come to a more stable point in my life - my relationship with this album has changed. Not in a bad way at all - if anything, my appreciation for a lot of these songs has grown deeply. I'm not going to say something like this album saved my life - I don't think my life was ever in danger to begin with - but I do think that these songs helped me meaningfully heal, and I owe it a lot for that. Until seeing it a second time, I didn't realize how much this album means to me. For context, I saw Nurture live in Boston on October 16th, 2021. That was an unforgettable experience. I got 2nd row tickets the day before the show for under face value, and I'm so so SO glad that I did. The setlist was everything I could ask for, including pretty much all of Nurture, and I was so excited to hear it live. As I got home that night, I was still glowing with how good it was, and I stayed up far too late replaying songs, rewatching my videos, and just reflecting on the incredible show. 

The second time, just recently, was the first stop of the SMILE! tour. I liked that album, as you can read about in its review, but I was mainly there for Nurture, first and foremost. As it was the first stop, I had no idea what the setlist would look like, and I was blown away. I have no shame in admitting that I had tears streaming down my face for pretty much the entire set. Musician, Something Comforting, Get Your Wish, Trying to Feel Alive + Look at the Sky, and ESPECIALLY Unfold. I would pay for a ticket if he just played Unfold, no joke. I don't know if any song has made me cry as much as that one has - and songs very, very rarely make me super emotional.

After that, I realized that I had to give this album a full-fledged review. In this review, I aim to both discuss the strong qualities that this album has musically, and the deep connection I personally hold to it. 

Immediately, the sound palette and general vibe of the album are established well with Lifelike !SM. It's gentle, and moving, and the tone on the piano is gorgeous - as it is throughout the album. That said, I can't necessarily separate it from what I know is coming after, and that makes it difficult to review. From the first plinks on the piano alone, I feel myself emotionally stirred. Even on its own, though, I think it holds up. The details on the strings, the blending of acoustic instruments and electronic production elements, and the spatial placement of each detail makes for a compelling opener. It sets the stage well for whole album, as the end fades quietly.

After Lifelike establishes the environment, Look at the Sky !SM immediately starts moving the listener along the journey of this albun. The introduction hooks you in right away - the inhale and exhale is just so perfect, and is followed by the gentle piano dropping right into the electronic elements of the song. That heavy bass, refrained melody, and airy synthetic vocal all build a wonderful atmosphere. I feel a deep connection to this song and the lyrics, which is uncommon for me. I feel now that the compelling, motivational part of this song doesn't necessarily apply to me anymore - I don't really doubt that I'll be okay, worry about what I'll manage to accomplish this year, or feel like I see the same melancholy or ennui in a deep blue sky. Importantly, though, I remember a time where I did feel that way. My personal growth, and consequently, catharsis, is deeply important to me, and I feel a deep gratitude to this song for keeping me sane when I felt that way. This deep personal resonance is supported well by the sound of this song, as the tone of the vocals, segments of piano, and structure of the build into the uplifting chorus + drop all make for an breathtaking listen. The interesting vocals, the compelling story, the wonderful sound palette, are all certainly present here, but my own journey with it is the more meaningful praise I can give it. Though I love how this song sounds, it's moreso that the quality of this song allowed it to have such a connection with me, and it's that personal connection that brings me back to this album.

Despite appearing much later in the album, I see Something Comforting !SM as somewhat of a twin to Look at the Sky to me. Perhaps it's just that I listened to them together many times, but these songs are forever linked in my head. The two different voices, the profoundly gripping lyrics, and that colossal drop. As the drums build with that rising air, into the alternating between big bass hits and synth stabs, this song crescendos so well.  I will never forget being second row at the 2021 show as everyone jumped at those first hits of the super punchy synth. This song is equal parts danceable and beautiful, and strikes a balance between the two that doesn't really exist on other albums. As the urge to dance fades away with the synths, Porter leaves us with a gorgeous outro. The airy vocals, the gentle piano line, and more than anything, the sound of an inhale and exhale that fills the listener with a sense of catharsis. To be comforted is so fundamental, and in asking for comfort, Porter delivers a track that brings me a real tranquility, comforting me even when times might be rough. For that, I'm grateful.

In place of comfort and catharsis, Get Your Wish !SM offers aspiration and ambition. After the dancing opening piano and distant wooden percussion lure you in, Porter immediately drops that fantastic main synth right on your head. Truly incredible, classic Porter Robinson production is so clear here. I'm totally incapable of listening to this song without a deep urge to start moving and singing along. Having seen this song live, a second time - I did float to the surface, quicker than I sank, I did walk on water, I did get my wish. The lyrics are good, the production is masterful, and it's really compelling. It ends the same way as it starts, gently laying you down after the ride that the song is.

Along with the other high-energy bangers, Musician !SM is another fantastic song. The origin story is actually fascinating, an unreleased demo with KKB which gets chopped, pitch shifted, and remixed into the final song, and what a song it is. A great instrumental, that tells a compelling story about doing what you need to, overcoming expectations and societal pressures, and following your passions. I'm particularly a fan of the live performance two step process - how do you do music?
1. You face your fears
2. You become your heroes

That simple! Really though, this song is a genuine and emotionally meaningful celebration of following your heart, that's just such a catchy and fun listen. This song has an almost magical quality to the sound, as even people who are highly skeptical of EDM, electropop, or synthpop find themselves connecting with this song. Something about those vocal chops, fast-paced drums, and addicting hooks makes for a song that has me coming back over and over. 

Moving onto the instrumental tracks (or nearly instrumental for Wind Tempos) is Wind Tempos and dullscythe. Wind Tempos !SM is a lot more of a slow burn than a lot of the other explosive, danceable tracks, but is raw and beautiful in its own way. A three minute build, gradually intensifying and pulling you in until it all falls away, leaving what is maybe the clearest, most beautiful moment on the album. The repeating piano, touches of vocals throughout the soundstage, pulling airy treble that really feels like wind - all disappears, leaving just the warmth of the piano and its fuzzy reverberance. It's simple, and elegant, and moving, and a million more things, but it's just gorgeous. If you were to hand me these two or three minutes of piano on a CD, out of context, I'm not sure I'd find it so stunning. In the context of what came before it, though, both in terms of this song and the past few tracks, it's just incredible. Similarly slow burn, though offering captivating progression over gentle introspection, is dullscythe !SM. dullscythe is one of the most fascinating experiments in production and progression I have ever heard. It takes the fringes of the sound palette of this album, in what initially seems like a cacophony of chaotic sounds, incorrectly syncopated and panning from ear to ear. Suddenly, just over halfway through, some coherent aspects emerge. A glowing tone stays playing, a consistent percussion pattern comes in, fragmented melodies come in, and clear piano cuts through all the noise. Suddenly, there's a real song here, and it's spectacular. The way dullscythe grows into its own composition is fantastic, and that main driving melody in one ear with the piano in the other grips me deeply every time. Absolutely love that song.

Finally, Unfold !SM, which is by far my favorite song on this album, and absolutely the most emotionally moving for me. These two things are not unrelated. There's so much of this song that was just a perfect fit for me when this album came out. There's a word I like - solastalgia - the feeling that you want to go home, you're homesick, even when you're already at home. In a world torn up by a pandemic and quarantine - "I wish I could go home". At that time, too, there were days where I felt as if I was shouldering the weight of the world. Now, I feel as if I still relate to this song, but differently.

I watched the water unfold. I am not the same as I was.

Though I no longer have to shoulder the weight of the world; I don't have to shoulder much weight at all, I know now that I'm capable of it. And that's what means the most to me. This song sounds wonderful, too. At 3:00, hits a truly unmatched peak. The rising instrumental into the shrill, compressed vocals that feels like it might be the end that drops everything right back onto you is just stunning. It feels so huge, so compelling, and I was sobbing when it happened live. I truly, truly adore this song, and I'm so grateful for the relationship I have with it. 

Through a diverse array of gentle vignettes of nature, explosive production, and deeply compelling narrative, Nurture cements itself as the most beautiful album I have ever heard. Every detail - from the cover art, naming, and backstory, to instrumental elements of that stunning piano, organic and airy production, and voice modulation - comes together to deliver a poignant listening experience. Through exploring themes of his own mental health struggles, creative barriers, personal relationships, and pure vulnerability, Porter offers the listener a space to reflect on similar things in their own lives. Over the hour-long runtime, it makes me feel like I want to dance, want to cry, and want to be a better person than I was before. No other album has such a deep, emotionally moving effect on me, and for that, I am deeply grateful. There are other albums that I sit in awe of their quality, other albums I'll pick apart forever due to their complexity, layering, and replayability, and even still more albums I'll throw on for easy, enjoyable, fun listening. When it's time to feel something, Nurture is my pick. This album speaks to my heart more than almost any other, and helped me through some of the worst times in my life. I have no doubt that the beauty, composition, and pure emotional experience that this album has to offer will have me listening to it for years, if not decades, to come.
