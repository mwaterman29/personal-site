Praise a Lord Who Chews But Which Does Not Consume; (Or simply, Hot Between Worlds)
Yves Tumor

This album is perfect. There is nothing about this album that I do not believe to be perfect. 

I really like complex music, in many ways. I appreciate when the major elements all play well together - when the lyrics interest or compel me, when the instrumentation captivates or moves me, and when songs progress over their duration. Moreover, I deeply appreciate a complexity in layering to music. Multiple elements are working synergistically create the best music - both in terms of when everything comes together well, when small details of texture, timbre, or small sounds stick out, or most importantly - when everything falls away to let some parts of the song truly shine.

There is no album that exemplifies my love of this essence of music than this album. To be honest, this isn't just an album I'm 'biased' towards. You can read about the elements that I'm biased towards (loud bass, pretty female vocals, cool synths) - but none of those are present here. Despite the fact that there's no 'cheap tricks' - at least in terms of getting me to like the album - still enjoy this more than anything else.

Over a year out from release, this album has not stopped growing on me. I think it is now my pick for best of all time, and it has my favorite song of all time on it. In listening, I consistently enjoy it more than literally anything else and see elements of quality that outshine all other albums. I'm going to go through each individual song - because I really believe there are elements to highlight in each.

Overall, though, I am deeply grateful to this album and the enjoyment it has given me over the past year and a half. I hope to stick with it for many more. I think it'll be a while until any album surpasses it. 
## God Is a Circle

This is a super compelling opening to this album. The stark, rapid breathing, and the shrill guitar stabs set the atmosphere perfectly. The main, subdued guitar and drums are fantastic, and the overall sound of this song is fantastic. It's such a standout opener and is absolutely incredible.  If this song was purely instrumental, it would be excellent. The lyrics and vocals add so much to it.

If I was to quote everything that's meaningful and compelling here I would have to paste over half the lyrics of the song. To me, the obvious standout is:

"Lovin' you, it hurts sometimes  
But I can't help it  
'Cause it makes me feel alive"

But it fits incredibly well among the rest of the lyrics. After that - the song continues to intensify and intensify as it progresses adding more and more until it becomes a wall of sound - until an abrupt end. This song rewards really, really close listening. After probably a hundred listens, I still pick out new things every time.

The guitar tone, sonic quality, and overall vibe of this song as an opener are unmatched. Everything I just listed is twice as good on the vinyl.

## Lovely Sewer

I love this song. The immediate open with the retro sound palette and vocals sets the tone so well. Then, as the contrast with the clear female vocals, percussion, and glittering background elements play so well against each other. 

Again, the lyrics are strong. You can't start a war just for the feeling. 

I think this song peaks multiple times - but truly at about 1:30. The layering of Yves' and Kidä's vocals over that guitar are so so good - with the quick synth line that pans from left to right - so insane. It feels like it keeps trying to pop back up as Yves' verse continues - before yielding back to Kidä. The back-and-forth element with just a short crossover is such beautiful symbolism for the theme of the song. A real form-follows-function moment.

Don't even get me started on the piano outro. Really beautiful, super strong.

## Meteora Blues

Ok - if I said 'I love this song' for every song, we'd be here all day. This song is truly incredible though. The percussion on this song is among the best of any song I've ever heard - the super muted blown out drums right at the beginning absolutely bang, and set the tension so well.

The tension is built up so well - right up until about 1 minute - where you hear a howling guitar far off to the left right as it drops into the main guitar line. Absolutely fantastic. 

This song isn't necessarily as interesting as the other songs on this album - but what it lacks in terms of fascinating elements (which aren't really lacking) - it makes up for in pure banger - which it delivers in spades

This song is a super accessible entry to what makes this album so incredible to me - fantastic guitar tone, incredible percussion, standout vocals, progression throughout the song, and small elements that reward extremely active listening. 

Speaking of active listening - the transition into the interlude is absolutely gorgeous.

## Interlude

I'm really glad this interlude exists. It almost feels like respite. It's really gorgeous and adds onto the theme of the album well. The holy vocals are a nice addition to the sound palette - and though it's just 40 seconds, I don't think the album would be the same without it.

## Parody

A nice drum roll falls right out of the heavenly vocals of the interlude, and follows up Meteora Blues so well. More insane percussion that leads into another major banger. Insane drop into the guitar, which contrasts Yves' high-pitch vocals so so well.

It continues to build - the howling, abrasive guitar feedback - reaching a distorted fever pitch, almost reminiscent of sewerslvt or drone metal - and the heavenly vocals both fade back in, moving from side to side. Then, everything fades away - the first example of letting one part of the song shine, making every element stand out so well - 

"What makes you feel so important?"

at 1:35 - the best moment yet comes in and drops this incredible - super clear and standout riff that just hits right to your core. As the vocals hang back, the guitar wails and just delivers a super standout heater. 

The intro - pitch shifted down and continuing the distorted guitar feedback - ending staunchly on the same line that peaked the song so hard - What makes you feel so important?

Insane.

## Heaven Surrounds Us Like A Hood

This is the best song I've ever heard. 
It's not close.

I will say - this song, I'm somewhat biased towards. In March of 2023, when this album came out, I was in Belgium. I don't think I'll ever forget what it feels like to stand in Bruges, hood up, earbuds in, my breath visible in the air due to the cold - this song the only thing I hear as I look at the light refracting from a stained glass window, a 14th century reliquary, or stunning religious art.

The quality of this song absolutely supports that experience, though, and there's no better song I could have picked. 

The song's start is really, really good - immediately, many elements playing well together. I love the deep guitar line, the percussion, the layered vocals. The lyrics, though cryptic, are moving, and pull you into the song well.

You'd think that the song peaks at the first moment the guitar drops in - and though it is truly incredible, that's not the best part of the song.

When everything fades away - and all that's left is the single guitar (which has the best tone of anything I have ever heard - genuinely) - over thunder, rain, birds chirping -truly, truly perfect. Then, the vocal pulls come in, and build the tension even more.

"I love the color blue because 
It's in the sky
And that's where God is"

Followed by the most incredible drop of any song I've ever heard. It flourishes in the best way possible - I genuinely get full body goosebumps every time. From 2:10 - 2:20 is the best ten seconds of music that exists.

The rest of the song is incredible too, but by that point, I'm too busy feeling like I'm going to start levitating or crying that it doesn't even matter. 

I honestly hope that something this good comes out in the future. I might not be surprised, but I really think it might be life changing if it does.

## Operator

Somehow, following the best song of all time is another one of the best. Scarily, I think it might be #2 - but there are other candidates for that for sure. 

This song is the perfect example of masterful complexity. There's so much going on, but it all works together so well. The best element in my opinion is the super standout - almost unsettling "eyes red.... eyes red" that drones and echoes throughout the song.

The guitar is again, incredible. The lyrics and vocal inflection work so well over it - as the other surrounding elements continue to build.

This song also reaches an incomprehensible peak at 2:30. As the lyrics and their delivery reach maximum emotion - you expect there to be another lyric after - 2:36, maybe 2:40? But there isn't.

A single lone 'eyes red' as the guitar is mixed a little louder - and it leaves one of the best melodies I have EVER heard playing so directly. As it draws you in so so strongly - it's so insanely compelling.

In terms of music that 'peaks' - to have two of the best examples back-to-back differentiate this album from all others by a solid margin. It's insane.

## In Spite Of War

This song is also among the more accessible - a little less complex, but still quite quality. The lyrics are more direct, don't progress as far. But don't think I'm scorning this song - I love this song and it's another easy listen while still being of incredible quality.

I've listened to this song with my windows down, cruising, for two summers now, and it's just fantastic.

I don't have much to praise about this song that isnt true about the other songs on the album. This is a great song - but not a massive differentiating factor, as far as the overall rating goes.

## Echolalia

This song is soooooooooooooo good. Another excellent song that shines not just because of how it sounds (which is incredible) - this song shines first and foremost because of the lyrical content and delivery.

The uncomfortable, anxious, breathy vocals are so convincing and fit the lyrics so incredibly well. I absolutely believe it when it's said:
"You know that you're making me uncomfortable
I see you standing there but you're all alone"

Super compelling while still being catchy and danceable. Incredible

## Fear Evil Like Fire

I LOVE THIS SONG. I don't understand why it has stuck with me so much but there was a period of a couple weeks where all I wanted to listen to was this song and Gears by Lunar Vacation.

Something about the instrumental just hits me in exactly the right way. This song's a really excellent night listen and I just keep coming back to it. 

I don't necessarily see a strong peak in this song like I do others, but I instead praise it for its consistency - throughout the runtime it's just strong, and I also just keep wanting to come back to it. I really can't praise it enough.

## Purified By The Fire

Really interesting instrumental. Probably my least favorite on the album but I still love it. Great song. I find the progression to be pretty interesting, and I love the stopping and starting of the different elements as it feels like the song marches forward.

## Ebony Eye

Holy what a closer. This song feels colossal. It is an absolute stick-the-landing moment in every way. Absolutely gorgeous and there were tears running down my face when I heard it live. The lyrics are so insane as well - I would happily read this as a poem

"These passing shadows in photographs of you
Your burning embrace, it's as warm as rain
I can't describe this glowing light"

Massive crescendos, huge percussion, vocal excellence - this is a great closer to the best album of all time.
