Jane Remover

Jane Remover's latest album is a wild experience from front-to-back: noisy, chaotic, and off-the-wall energetic - for better and for worse. At its best, it's a danceable, super catchy, genre-crushing record that displays real talent and innovation. Blending rage, digicore, electroclash, and even the work of her aliases in dariacore and indie rock, this album is a fascinating collection of innovative tracks. She pushes on every front, delivering a forward-thinking, genre-melding, explosive album. At times - this pushes too far, leaving tracks that feel compressed, harshly mixed, and unmastered. Still, this is an incredibly enthralling listen, one that yields continued interest even after months of active listening. In this review, I'll dive into both where this album energetically engages the listener, nails a variety of production styles, and masterfully synergizes genres to hit pinnacle highs; all balanced against its moments of overeager production and messy mixing.

If nothing else, this album absolutely exudes energy. It's hyper, frenetic, almost overwhelming - and out of that comes many tracks that are highly engaging and danceable. Professional Vengeance !SM is a great example of this - a quintessential pop song with a Jane Remover coat of paint. The bouncy beat, pleasant vocal tone, and easily-followed rhythm make this great to bob your head and sing along to. I'm particularly charmed by her delivery on the bridge, I love the delivery of 'I still got the world in my hands'. Beyond the vocals, the synergy between the rapid percussion, glittering high end, and punchy bass keeps the instrumental extremely engaging. This hits its apex at the end, with the pure hardstyle ending. Though it is a bit too intense for my taste, it was certainly fun live. Earlier in the album is another incredible, danceable track - the standout single from the album, Dancing with your eyes closed !SM, which is just so sick. "Jealous? You don't even exist!" A perfect mix of ultra-digital production and danceable beats with rage elements that results in this standout track. Moreover, this is a bright spot for the mixing and mastering: the vocals are quite clear, and the melody also nicely centered and punchy. Structurally, this song is excellent - as the back and forth between the alternating tracks of 'Promise I like it like that' is super compelling and infectiously energetic. The drop into what I might call electroclash is also just awesome - I still totally have the appetite for that early 2010s over-the-top EDM and it works perfectly here. All in all a fantastic track - whether I'm dancing or driving, it's a great listen, and one I'll keep coming back to. 

Speaking of that digital production - it's true across the album, with its digicore and dariacore DNA being core to the sound here. Under her 'leroy' alias, Jane Remover pioneered the dariacore genre - known for its internet-culture sample flips and digital sound. Although she's since retired the mantle, she's no less talented as a producer, which is clearly demonstrated throughout the album. On TURN UP OR DIE !SM, the near-cacophony of 8-bit melodies, odd samples, rich bass, and her vocals make for an enjoyable track. Structurally, the song is a reversal of the normal formula: palatable intro which descends into crushing hardstyle with slamming bass and rapid, punchy kicks. Here - we get the opposite, as the intro fills the role of the strong, punchy section of the song. Transitioning through a glitchy refrain and beautiful bridge with the 'we freeze, we fall'. The song peaks with the lead into an energetic riser and punctuated J-J-J-J, before finally hitting the bouncy and rhythmic section that fits the namesake call to TURN UP or DIE! I'll choose to turn up, thanks. Similarly, Dreamflasher !SM is another great track, one that certainly shows off its dariacore roots: opening on samples from Duke Nukem to Mario Kart, even including part of the "This song is garbage" leroy tag. In addition to the sample flips, the lyrics fit well over the slamming bassline and arpeggiated melodies. Having seen this album live, I can attest to the reality of "a thousand people scream my name". This song rocks, easily grabbing the attention of listeners with the slamming bass and chaotic layers. Though they both suffer from volume issues and minor separation issues, there's much more to praise than criticize here. Slamming bass, ripping melodies, and a plethora of samples that all work well. 

Beyond the variety of samples, this album also strikes the perfect balance between diversity of sounds and coherent end-to-end vision, with many tracks rounding out the edges of the juxtaposition between experimental rap and digicore. Fadeoutz !SM is largely in line with the rest of the album: glitchy chirps, far-off vocal samples, and distorted bass. However, this time, the instrumentation turns melancholy - underpinning her lyricism: "I feel love just like a pop star // Til it turns into a problem for me and all my friends". This is a welcome addition, undoubtedly a successful foil to both the strong rage tracks and the vibrant electronic ones. It's refreshing to hear this chaotic sound palette used in this way, demonstrating Jane's versatility. At other times, it's not the vibe that changes genre, but the instrumentation. Star people !SM is a perfect example of this, as the song has two distinct halves, both of which work well. The first half, a hyper and energetic rage track, with frenetic synths and clattering percussion underlining her rapid delivery. Across the first two verses, it's highly energetic, with the "twisting, turning" and "let it happen to me" being particularly captivating. The second half, despite being a huge sonic shift, is even better. The heavy guitar strums, wandering top-end, and distant sound makes for a pleasant contrast from the rest of the album. Across both halves, Jane delivers an enjoyable track, proving her prowess as a producer and guitarist.

She continues her excellent guitar work on Experimental Skin !SM - a strong candidate for best song on the album. That guitar tone sounds straight off of Ghostholding, but this time mixed with that sparkling 8-bit arpeggio and punchy bass. The lyrics are quite enjoyable, and reap aura well in my opinion. I'm particularly a fan of the delivery of "I'm a shapeshifter" and "I'm a new kind of bitch off kilter". Quite effective, as the middle of the song strikes a nice balance between chaos and precision, with those awesome pulling synths and guitar strums. In a world where this is a three and a half minute song, I'm giving it a much less positive review. The beginning is a bit messy and hard to resolve. After that, it's great - almost feeling like it should end at 3:26, on the lone "you don't even know what you do to me". But it doesn't end. Instead, it goes somewhere I couldn't have imagined it going. The last minute and a half of this song is the pinnacle of this album: purely perfectly produced and arranged, drawing me to this song over and over. Every element works in absolute symphony delivering digital euphoria. I'd characterize it as electroclash, and it's probably the best electroclash I've ever heard. It's no secret I'm a huge 2hollis fan, and this has the same mix of slamming bass, huge drops, arpeggiated synths, punchy percussion, and catchy sound that makes his music compelling. Here, it's turned up to eleven. All-in-all, it's an incredible song, probably the best on the album.

Although the end of Experimental Skin is peak, the beginning feels compressed and unmastered. After the break through the noise, it's perfect - but it demonstrates problems of volume, clarity, and resolution that occur frequently throughout album. Another example - TWICE REMOVED !SM, where it feels weirdly quiet, despite serving the role of an explosive opener with slamming bass.  I can appreciate an album that is meant to be enjoyed loud, but it's a failure that this *needs* to be listened to loud. As a dedicated fan, it's frustrating, as for the four singles that came out before this album, no clarity or volume issues are present. For example, Flash in the Pan is a perfectly well-mastered track that's fully clean and clear, coming out fairly close to this album. I fully understand that, to an extent, this is an intentional choice that works for some listeners. Look at the angels in camo music video - it quite literally says 'master: none' - clearly written with intent. There's something appealing about noise, chaos, and disorder, but that doesn't have to extend to the mixing and mastering. Clear playback through highly resolving IEMs or hi-fi speakers shouldn't yield issues of separation, lack of clarity, and poor staging. The underlying material is excellent on almost every song, so it's unfortunate to have the songs' quality decreased by lack of post-processing work. Yes - the songs still get great scores, but they could easily be 5-10 points higher across the board. 

Engaging with this album has been thoroughly enjoyable: from the release cycle, to the live show, to the deep engagement with the tracks while writing this review. Through diving deep on each song, I've found the ability to get past the noise and chaos, and appreciate this album for what it excels at. Though at times, I find it difficult to listen to, when I've got the appetite to turn my volume up and move along with the beat, this album completely excels. At times, I'm drawn in by the compelling guitars, banging basslines, and driving melodies. Others, I'm dancing along with the bouncy beats and punctuated percussion. Further still, I'm dazzled by the sample flips, instrumental arrangment, and genre-melding fusions. For all of these qualities, I have no doubt that this album will stay in my rotation for years to come. As she has for years now, Jane Remover continues to deserve our attention as fans, and I can't wait for what sound she'll pioneer next.
