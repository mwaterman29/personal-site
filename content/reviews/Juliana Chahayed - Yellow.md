Yellow
Juliana Chahayed

Absolutely love this song - this is exactly my style of music and I cannot get enough of it. It's not necessarily too dissimilar from other alt/electropop in terms of sound palette, but in every way, it makes the absolute perfect choices that results in an extremely tight, enjoyable, almost addictive track.

The intro is great - cold, subdued stabs, far-off vocals that you can't quite make out, pulling you immediately into the song. As the drums come in, and her vocals come forward, the song starts to hit its stride. I find her vocal tone to be very pleasant - I really love this sort of vocals, especially over synths - high-pitched, elegant, breathy - but not sibilant or textureless. 

This song absolutely sticks the landing on the chorus as well - it's INSANELY catchy, and the instrumental supports the structure of the song well, as all the wavering and panning elements drop fully away for an extremely direct, tight, and unbelievably enjoyable chorus. It's so catchy, so well-produced, and I couldn't really imagine it being better. The ingredients are so simple, but they synergize excellently.

The lyrics are also very good - not truly remarkable - but an obvious and well-structured vignette of tension in love, between too much and too little, being clingy or being distant. They complete the song well, and I have no complaints about them.

The only 'complaint' I have is the outro. If there was a more elegant or creative ending, I could see this song being rated even higher. Though it's not bad, after 100+ listens, it is a little played out. It doesn't drag the song down - I appreciate that it's more than just slow+reverb, and the abrupt ending is a nice touch - but it doesn't particularly raise my enjoyment, either.

Despite that - this song is easy to sing along to, enjoyable to listen to, and just plain catchy. It's been in my rotation for months now, and will likely continue to be for months to come.
