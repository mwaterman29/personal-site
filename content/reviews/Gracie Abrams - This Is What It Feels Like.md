This Is What It Feels Like
Gracie Abrams

Gracie Abrams needs no introduction - following The Secret of Us, and the unfortunate popularity of That's So True, she's been catapulted to stardom, with millions of monthly listeners. Back in November of 2021, when this EP came out, that was not the case. On This Is What It Feels Like, Gracie's sound is markedly less refined. As I wasn't an avid listener at the time of its release, I can only review this album in retrospect - through the lens of having already fallen in love with Good Riddance; having been disappointed by The Secret of Us. Looking back, at times she experiments with sounds and styles that don't work well. Other times, it feels like she's starting to dial in the sound I fell in love with on Good Riddance.  Further still, there are unique highlights that don't fit in with the rest of her discography, in a great way. Through each, her incredible vocals shine through, but don't manage to carry every song. In this review, I'll analyze this variety of sounds, tracing her weaker efforts, continuing into clear signs of development, into the unique highlights this EP has to offer - concluding on how this variety places it as a whole. 

Many of these songs seem to carry weaker styles and sounds, leaving me a bit confused as a listener. The obvious example is Wishful Thinking !SM, one of her worst songs in my opinion. The instrumental leaves a lot to be desired - the simple drums, weird bass, and ineffective pacing simply doesn't draw me in as a listener. It seems like it's missing something - there's little that's going to have me singing along or being moved emotionally. It's not a terrible song - her voice is largely agreeable, and the end is enjoyable - but it just doesn't succeed in what it's trying to do. Less egregious, though still somewhat ineffective is Painkillers !SM. The initial structure is pretty good - the muted gentle piano and subdued vocals are sufficiently engaging as a fan of that style. That said - the rest of the song feels largely directionless. The slight voice modulation on the extended "I"s with the reverberant and bassier piano stabs don't do nearly enough to progress the song, nor to serve as a foil to the introduction of the track. This is doubly true for the end of the song - the compressed and thin vocal effect, albeit pleasant enough, doesn't bring the listener anywhere. For a two-minute song, it's not a critical failure, but I can't help but feel that the track suffers from being underdeveloped. 

Continuing on that theme - there similarly are many moments where it's the lyricism, not the instrumentation that feels underdeveloped compared to her future work. Good Riddance has many highlights that display exceptional imagery, from the evocative kerosene and forest-fire of Full Machine, to the pithy fridge light in a dark kitchen of Right Now. On For Real This Time !SM, the uncertainty is a bit loose. The setup line "A thousand times, I got up to say goodbye" prepares the listener for a strong conclusion: that's it, we're done, it's over! Instead, we get "I could be wrong, but I think that I'm for real this time". The phrasing is clunky, weak, and not nearly as forceful or compelling as it should be. Moreover, the echoing of "this time" is a nice effect, but the emphasis is ineffective. Other times, the lyricism feels a bit meandering. On Camden !SM - though much of it works well - there's one segment that sticks out as a failure to me. She sings "At least I'll never turn to cigarettes // My brother shielded me from all of that // He said that smoking was a killer". In a song that touches on self-diagnosis, isolation, body dysmorphia, I'm not particularly sure what the point of these lines are. With the second line of "Can't picture anything past 25", you'd expect further exploration of hopelessness, feeling directionless, crying for help. Instead, we get echoes of an anti-smoking PSA that don't further the narrative of the song effectively. Though I love the piano on this track, and it has meaningful progression throughout, it'd be a much better track with improved writing.

Despite these underdeveloped moments, there are many that are indicative of the further development and maturation of her songwriting. Particularly, they seem to start honing the soft, vulnerable, almost confessional nature of Good Riddance, both in her vocals and the supporting instrumentation. On Hard to Sleep !SM, the gentle piano, intimate vocals and repeated "this isn't me" work to build a moving, somber track, one that reflects well on overthinking, and losing sleep. I'm particularly a fan of the bridge where, for the second half, we get a second layer of her voice. On much of her future work, there's two or three layers of her voice, which makes for an incredible signature sound. It works well throughout Good Riddance, and it's pleasant to see it here. Older !SM is a similar track, reliant on the synergy between the softened piano and the cutting, gossamer sound of her vocals. It is again, effective throughout the verses. I enjoy the choruses - I find the lilting delivery of her voice to keep me intrigued as a listener - it feels as if her voice dances along with the piano. Moreover, the way she strains into a whisper on "Or am I too *draining*?" deeply grips me as a listener. Finally - the hum that still has slight wisps of her whispery voice leading into the outro is a great detail. Although the hum is not as developed as the future Block me out, nor is the piano as perfect as the guitars that will accompany her in the future - both these songs are fantastic. On the theme of guitars - I think she starts to dial that in, too. On Augusta !SM, the combination of the even-keeled guitar and her drawn out delivery makes for a wonderful pairing. Each line is framed perfectly by the melody: "California... makes me exhaused" and "How... the leaves in the fall feel like closure" both work very well. All in all, despite the instrumental sounding too simple, too rustic, too 'farmhouse' for my taste - it's clear that this early work set the foundation well for her future songs. Continuing on vocal-instrumental synergy, there's Rockland !SM, where the clear guitar scaffolds her vocals well. During the verses, the bright strums contrast well from her downtrodden delivery, and during the chorus the bassier plucks complement her punctuated "Bet you... wish you... never even met me" perfectly. Structurally, this song also mirrors some of the standout tracks of Good Riddance, with an incredible bridge. Like the bridges of Block me out and Unsteady, Rockland's bridge is fantastic, with the repeated "you cut deep", complemented by the details of the instrumental to hit a real peak on this song. Both further speak to her continued development, and are enjoyable listens.

Finally - this album has highs of its own - ones that don't feel like Good Riddance, nor any of her other work. The opening track, Feels Like !SM is exceptional, and is deservedly the standout track from this EP. From the very beginning, opening on her gentle, whispered vocals over the subdued piano, this song is very engaging. Then, transitioning into the prechorus as her vocals open up, into the chorus of the eponymous 'This is what it feels like' is fantastic. It hits an incredible peak during the second verse, ending on the remarkably rich extension at the end of "Your phone was playing 'Towers' and I...". Her vocal progression as the *I* hangs and trails off is among the best moments in her entire discography, and still has me returning to this song time and time again. Stylistically very different, yet equally as good is The Bottom !SM. As I wrote when it was my [#2 song of 2024](https://www.mwaterman.dev/music/essays/Top%2010%20of%202024%2C%20Annotated.md), it feels like a bad song that sounds really, really good. Yes, the instrumental isn't that engaging, and yes, she does unironically use 'down bad'. Despite that, this is her catchiest song, and is plainly one of the catchiest songs I've ever heard. Her vocal tone and texture fit my taste perfectly. The perfect mix of gentle whisper, intoxicating sibilance, and warm timbre has had me addicted to the song for hundreds of listens.  Despite the instrumental's simple and straightforward feel - it's still effective, and supports the chorus particularly well. The kicks perfectly emphasize her words: 'hard to **ignore** // all of my **problems** // gonna **regret** // being too **honest**'. Moreover - I'm particularly charmed by the clashing feeling of a happy, upbeat song about being inadequate, no good, dragging down whoever's stuck with you. It's a highly effective juxtaposition, especially as I keep returning to this song. Despite her telling you that she's no good, you should walk out, it's now or never - that extended delivery with just a touch of vibrato on the 'never' has me coming back over and over. Due to their exceptional quality, and my personal connection to them, I've come to cherish both these songs. Before moving into Boston proper, there were many a long commute accompanied by both these songs. Although I can't pretend I ever enjoyed the hour plus spent on 93 south, singing along with my windows down on a cool early summer morning made it feel just a bit more tolerable. Connecting music to certain places, certain weather, or certain experiences makes for strong attachment to songs - as I now hold towards Feels Like and The Bottom. 

Though I never got to truly engage with this album before Good Riddance colored my view, it's still a largely enjoyable and successful album from end-to-end. Yes, at times, her ideas are underdeveloped, but they're more than outweighed by the highlights of this EP. From the beautiful whispery vocals of Older and Alright, to the instrumental development of Hard to Sleep and Rockland, to the standout tracks of Feels Like and The Bottom, there's a lot to love here. Even if, in many ways, this EP must live in the shadow of what came after, it still absolutely shines on its own. Looking back - it is, on the whole, an appreciable and enjoyable effort with many memorable songs and moments. Looking forward - I know there's many a summer morning where I'll be singing along to The Bottom, and for that, I'm grateful to this album. I can only hope that the highs reached here will be surpassed on her next album.
