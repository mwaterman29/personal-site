Wow, I had high expectations after how much I loved 2, but I'm still very impressed. This album alternates between extremely intense and very catchy, and generally handles both excellently. 'you once said my name for the first time' and 'teenage soldier' are super heavy, super intense, but very very strong songs - very powerful and compelling listens - both competing for the best song I've heard all year. Then, there's two bad, say it again, and especially light, which are extremely enjoyable and catchy listens.

The back and forth between ripping you apart and catchy listen is super unique, and I expect to be coming back to this album for a long time. A few songs aren't total standouts, and sister's a little weird ngl but the overall sound and production are genuinely exceptional.
