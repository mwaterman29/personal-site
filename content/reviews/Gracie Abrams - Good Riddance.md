Good Riddance
Gracie Abrams

On Saturday, February 25th, 2023, I stepped out of my childhood home, snow crunching underfoot as I walked down the steps to get into the car for a long drive down to see some family. During that drive was my first listen to Good Riddance, which had come out just a couple days prior. A long drive, cozied up in the back seat, watching the frozen landscapes pass by outside. In my ears was Good Riddance: the story of a girl adrift and overwhelmed, unsuccessful in love and struggling to find her place, told through gentle instrumentals and whispered vocals, delivering a deeply enjoyable albeit melancholic record from front to back. Though I didn't know it then, I had picked the perfect context to experience this album for the first time. In a way, there's a real parity with the themes of this album: despite being an adult with a normal full-time job, I'm wrapped in a blanket, being driven by my parents, with comfy clothes and my earbuds in. In both, it feels as if there's something soft, something gentle, with a thin barrier separating the cold world outside. I'm glad I chose a long car ride cold winter day to listen to this album, as it was the perfect start for my growing relationship with this album. Over the past couple years, spurred by hundreds of listens across the tracks, I've come to deeply appreciate this album - not just for its themes, sound, and content, but also for its greater role among my most listened albums. On Good Riddance, Gracie Abrams offers us a poignant and vulnerable glimpse into her own introspective journey, one which resonates with listeners who enjoy her melancholic songs and signature whispered vocals.

Across these tracks, there are common themes, emergent from a rending introspection - guilt for unresolved emotions, leaving things unsaid, past action and inaction in relationships. These problems, despite being small or pithy when looked at with a clear head, can feel so world-ending when you're going through them. That fundamental tension, between the reality of small problems and their feeling so huge is foundational to the emotional impact of this record - one that's well cultivated by the storytelling and imagery. I find the imagery on this record to be generally successful - both when it's about small things to cultivate a pathetic, downtrodden feeling, or about big ones to emphasize the emotional impact of the story being told. Many times, the small details contribute well to the feelings of being depressed, hopeless, and overwhelmed by a world that's far too big for you. I think this is most obvious on Right now !SM: "And the light in the kitchen // From the fridge on the floor". The small, intimate details are purely evocative of being homesick - something that you probably should have grown out of by now. Next, on The blue !SM, "You say we share a brain // Apologizing for it // But take it as a compliment // You make me really nervous". Between the pacing, the shakiness in her voice, and the trailing off at the end, she paints a compelling picture of exactly what she's singing about: being a nervous girl, uncertain to trust again. Throughout the tracks here, there are many instances of the small, confessional, even pathetic feeling being cultivated very well.  Other times, the vignettes she describes are so intense, and provide a good foil to the gentle delivery. The contrast between the intensity of the lyrics and the gentleness of the vocals is both elegant and compelling, and helps the listener experience a range of emotions across the songs. On Full machine !SM, I'm consistently moved by the lines: "I'm a forest fire // You're the kerosene". Clear, direct, relatable imagery about burning that bolsters the emotional impact of the song. Similarly, on Block me out !SM: "I think I'm burning alive, but nobody sees the fire // 'Cause when I open my mouth, I seem to be stuck in silence". A powerful statement on how paralyzing and crushing depression can be. Across these tracks, Gracie delivers moving vignettes from forest fires to kitchen fridges, allowing the reader to empathize with the greater album themes of her heartbreak, longing, and emotional processing.

In addition to her quality storytelling, at other times, this album just passes the test for sounding good. Though I've pulled apart every song, listened for small details, analyzed the writing, etc - I really do just love the sound of this album. When considering albums that I really love, I think a good place to start is the standout quality that makes me love each album. For the Yves Tumor album, it's my belief that it has the best song of all time on it, and that the rest of the album can even come close to that quality. For Nurture, it's the emotional attachment I have towards the album, and the beauty and vulnerability that let me grow that attachment. For we had good times together, it's the genre-defining highlight tracks, and their incredibly quality and complexity. For Good Riddance, it's Gracie's vocals, plain and simple. I wrote at length in my essay on the subject about how I deeply love whispered and breathy vocals. No album exemplifies that more than this one, as there's moments of vocal excellence on every single track here. For me, I'm particularly moved by vocals that retain texture and tone while being as close to a true whisper as possible, which appear frequently throughout the record. I think Gracie, better than pretty much any other vocalist, perfectly brushes up against a true whisper, while still maintaining the rich timbre of her voice. Touches of vibrato, clearly audible inhales and exhales, and dropping into a true whisper, all add significant depth to the vocals. For example, on Best !SM: "It was my little strange addiction". The word 'addiction' is delivered so softly, and is so compelling as it fades to a whisper, as the delivery of the line synergizes well with the confessional nature of the lyric. On Fault Line, in "Most nights, I will pretend I left this sooner", the extension of the word sooner is incredible, as the way she closes out the word with a whisper is so rich. Similarly, on This is what the drugs are for !SM, "I almost called a hundred times" - the way the word "times" is drawn out has me so drawn in. Though I've pointed out just a handful of examples, these little peaks happen on every song, as her vocals deliver emotion and vulnerability through the whisper. I enjoy songs the most when I can keep coming back to them, and picking out new details and moments each time. Here, this richness to the vocals significantly bolsters the replay value of each song, and rewards active listening well, both of which contribute well to the scores of these tracks.

Though the primary driver of my enjoyment for these songs is the vocals, not the instrumentals, there are moments with excellent synergy. First and foremost is on Where do we go now? !SM, towards the end of the second verse. On the second-to-last line, "What a brutal way to die", I find the way the instrumental bends up to match the vocals in the right ear to be so elegant. Other times, there's a back-and-forth with the instrumentals that makes for very enjoyable listens. On Full machine !SM, the post-chorus is fantastic, as the instrumental elements and vocals are woven together so well, with good percussion too!  That said, I don't think the instrumentals are fantastic across the board. Here, there's not nearly the same level of complexity as there is on pretty much any of my other favorite albums - the heavenly guitars from Yves Tumor, the perfect atmospheric percussion from Sewerslvt, or the crushing industrial production from Death Grips. Maybe it's unrealistic to expect Gracie to get production from Yves Tumor or Ecco2k, but I can't help but think how much better it'd be than budget Jack Antonoff. A much more realistic touchpoint for me is probably Speak for Yourself by Imogen Heap. Though their respective sounds are quite far apart, they are both foundational albums from exceptional vocalists. Despite enjoying the themes and vocals of this record more, Speak for Yourself is ultimately the superior record - primarily due to the production and composition. Gracie is an incredible vocalist, certainly my favorite, and I find her voice to absolutely carry every song its on. However, that can only take it so far, and the simplicity of the instrumentals that sometimes support the downtrodden themes also often hold the songs back from being truly peak. I wish I could imagine a Headlock or an I'm God coming from the songs here - a song that lives a dozen lives as every aspect of it is pulled apart and recontextualized into a whole family of songs - but I don't think that's the case. Yes, I believe that Amelie and Full Machine are exceptional songs, but I see further potential to really reach that upper echelon of tracks. Textured synths, complex percussion, otherworldly vibes are all things that can absolutely work well in sad songs, and they would absolutely elevate the contents of this album.

Beyond the vocals and instrumentals, there are a couple standout bridges on two of the deluxe tracks that are worth discussing. One of the best moments on this whole album is on the least streamed song - Unsteady !SM. The bridge near the end - starting with "Lately I've been staring at the ceiling" - is plainly incredible. It's by far the best moment on the song, and is one of the best on the whole album. Between her vocals, the shift in the instrumental, and the transition out of the bridge, it's fantastic. Similarly, on the song before it: Block me out !SM. Though I talked about the imagery earlier, I actually think the real highlight is the bridge, which is extremely good when listened to closely. The separation of the two layers of vocals is crazy good - the clearer, higher pitched, impassioned vocals; the other taking up more of the sound stage, near the bottom of her range, spoken gently. The combined vocals - both fading to a whisper as the instrumental drops out, eventually leading to just a couple seconds of silence has the emotional tension hit an incredible apex. This tension is resolved well, too, between Gracie's gentle hum, the guitar coming back, and a short instrumental interlude, this bridge catapults the song to one of my favorites. 

Finally, before closing out this review, I'd like to highlight a couple other moments that I didn't get to discuss as part of my other points. Pretty much the whole of Amelie !SM is a highlight for me - a song I so instantly latched onto, making a huge emotional impact despite the more stripped-back instrumental on the whole record. I think we've all met an Amelie - someone who just makes you doubt everything you've ever known after talking to them - and the way Gracie gets at this idea is deeply compelling to me. On Difficult !SM, a pair of highlights. Though I love Gracie's high-pitched vocals, her humming near the bottom of her range is wonderful too before the start of each chorus, there's a couple lines with a hum that I love; an even smaller detail - the (I) on the post-chorus into the bridge, another little touch that has me appreciating this song on my tenth, fiftieth, even hundredth listen. These small moments of excellence contribute not only to my enjoyment of the individual songs, but my overall reverence for this album. For a record that sounds so gentle, so vulnerable, so heart-wrenching - it's only fitting that attention and care were paid to the sound and texture of each song. When making an album that needs to feel authentic, a high degree of tact and precision feels necessary to convince the listener that you mean what you say. Here, I'm more than convinced, and I appreciate that this album feels genuine.

In closing, Good Riddance is a great album. It's not for everyone, certainly, but for those of us who enjoy sad girl, vulnerability, and whispered vocals, this album is excellent. Nearly two years since its release, and I still listen to it all the time. It's constantly being added to playlists, being played on the turntable, or being admired on my wall of records. As with many of my favorite albums, I feel a real sense of gratitude to this album. It's helped me relate with friends, and been the soundtrack to many a night drive. It's made me a better music critic. It's helped my articulate and solidify my love for breathy vocals. And of course, it's provided many, many hours of enjoyable listening, from quiet mornings to late nights. Yes, this album is not perfect - but that said, stacking this album against others - I consistently listen to it, I love the time I've spent with it, and I want to talk about it all the time. For that, it deserves the high score it receives. Ultimately though, the beauty of Good Riddance comes from more than just its sound, but also from the deeper truths of life that it examines - to live, to love, to lose, offering listeners solace on those cold winter mornings and melancholic nights.
