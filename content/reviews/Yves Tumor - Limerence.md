Limerence - a state of mind resulting from romantic feelings for another person. It typically involves intrusive and melancholic thoughts, or tragic concerns for the object of one's affection, along with a desire for the reciprocation of one's feelings and to form a relationship with the object of love.

If any song suits its name perfectly - it’s this one. If you gave me years at a DAW, at a desk with pen and paper, or at an easel, I’m not sure I could get the idea across as well as this song does. Love - often explored but rarely captured successfully - feels absolutely perfect here.

If I had to liken it to anything, I’d pick a vignette that I’d hope is relatable to everyone. Imagine staying in bed and holding someone who you think is your other half as you watch the rain from a dimly lit room on a fall morning. The murmur of the rain, the light filtered through the gray clouds, and the desire for this moment to never, ever end. 

It’s so perfectly evocative of the anachronism of love. It doesn’t matter how it felt yesterday, or how it will feel tomorrow, you just don’t want it to end. As the basis of the instrumental is established immediately, and remains largely unchanged throughout the track, there’s a tranquility that doesn’t care how long the song is. If this song was an hour long, I wouldn’t mind. 

Another incredible aspect of this song is the conversational track. Many songs are a first-person experience: the artist tells a story relating to some common experience. Others are a second-person experience, as the artist speaks directly to the audience. This song, though, is a different sort of “third-person” experience, and that vibe comes primarily from the conversational track. This song feels deeply observational, even retrospective. We are clearly not the intended audience for the voice in the song, which cultivates a unique and effective vibe for the track.

Finally, the rain and thunder tracks. The instrumental alone is gorgeous ambiance, but the storm sounds are a wonderful addition. It is a truly timeless addition: regardless of whether guitars, piano, or drums are in or out of style - stormy weather is truly universal. It compliments the soundscape well, offering further gentle ambiance. 

Moreover, both the voice and the storm track are just as powerful in absence. Towards the middle of the track, both fall away, leaving these distant, pulling strings, that push the impact of this song to its peak. Very reminiscent of Within by Leavv - probably the best lo-fi song of all time. The whole composition of the track is so excellent. It leaves the listener with just enough time to introspect, before the thunder crashes again. Just a moment, for the gentle tone of the beat and the straining strings to reach your heart, before snapping you out of it. That feeling, created so masterfully, is truly singular. In every note, I get the feeling of "this could last forever and I wouldn't mind". Extremely compelling - and unlike any other song I'm aware of. 

This is an old song, much earlier than the body of work that led me to respect Yves Tumor as one of the most incredible, innovative, and talented artists. I believe Heaven Surrounds Us Like a Hood is the best song of all time, and their body of work contains myriad other incredible songs (Jackie, Operator, Secrecy..., Gospel for a New Century, etc). This song is absolutely nothing like the others. No perfect guitar tone, shattering riffs, striking vocals. No memorable hook, standout lyrics, and no apex on the song that you just can't forget. Despite all of that, I genuinely think this might be one of the best songs I have ever heard.

In a way, this song feels like an emergent phenomenon. I plan to expand upon that idea in an essay - but the short of it is that music can't exist without this song existing, and someone just had to make it. There's glimpses of near-universal experiences hear - love, peace, obsession, rain, autumn - and with that, someone had to make a song like this. To that end, I could not be more glad that it was Yves Tumor taking up the mantle, as the execution is absolutely perfect. There are days when I feel like this is the most moving song I have ever had the pleasure of listening to.

In closing - I'm glad this song has gotten a lot of attention. Though I'm no fan of TikTok - nor the commodification of music that it often requires - it does make me happy to see my favorite artist get support on some of their finest work. We live in a beautiful, and at times, melancholic world. This song reminds me of that. For that, it deserves the extremely high score it receives.
