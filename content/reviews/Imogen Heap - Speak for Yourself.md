Speak For Yourself
Imogen Heap

I've long been a fan of Imogen Heap. As I wrote in my essay on breathy vocals, I came to know of Hide and Seek very early in life, and have been a fan ever since. I love her work with Frou Frou, her forward-thinking production style, and more than anything else, her breakout 2005 album Speak for Yourself. Recently, I saw an old friend listening to Headlock, which I didn't expect at all - but she's a good litmus test for where the culture's at. Finally - this album (and Headlock) is getting the appreciation it deserves. Although I was going to save this review for the 20th anniversary of this album this summer - with the big resurgence it's getting now - I think it's a fitting time to review it. Speak For Yourself is the definitive cornerstone release from Imogen Heap, the ultra-talented, self-produced vocalist and composer who has been ahead of her time for decades. I've been a fan of this album for about as long as I can remember, and it's one of the best of all time, holding up remarkably well over it's twenty years of existence. In this review, I'll talk about the qualities that make it exceptional, how well the sound holds up, and the gratitude I have for foundational role it plays in many of my favorite songs.

Even in the very first minute of this album, its standout qualities are obvious - gorgeous vocals, intriguing production, coherent composition, and that hard-to-describe magic that makes a hit a hit. I wrote at length in my essay on vocals about how Imogen Heap and her breathy, whispery vocal style shaped my taste deeply. Throughout the tracks here, there are exceptional moments of gorgeous vocals. On Goodnight and Go !SM, "the corner cafe" and her delivery of "tectonic // tremblings..." is unbelievable - dropping in and out of a whisper with the layering hums and instrumental stab under it - incredible work. Moreover, the fully whispered "Go" that leads into the instrumental bridge is similarly fantastic. On The Walk !SM, the chorus has that same intoxicating whispered delivery, alternating between an impassioned delivery and that beautiful airy falsetto, to great effect. If I had to ascribe any quality to her vocals - it would be 'glowing'. Emerging from her ethereal whispers, sustained breathiness, and humming layers comes this feeling of light breathed into the tracks, it feels as if they glow. Of course, this quality is present on many other songs, and contributes well to the very high average score here, as I find this quality of glowing to be extremely engaging.

That said -  there's a different version of her vocals worth highlighting, with one of the most iconic tracks from this album. When talking about vocals, it's impossible to not bring up Hide and Seek !SM, a true stroke of genius and proof that the human voice is the best instrument. On Hide and Seek, the only 'instrument' is a number of layers of her voice, that combine into an incredible symphonic effect that has me just as amazed twenty years after its release. At its softest, the eponymous "Hide and Seek" - small shreds of her voice, constrained to a whisper. At its strongest, the layers of her voice bend and warp, with an emergent synthetic sound that is so deeply compelling, particularly in the phrase "appear on walls".  That warping, almost mechanical feel to each syllable has had me coming back to this track for over a decade now. And of course - you can't talk about Hide and Seek without discussing the incredibly iconic 'Mmm, whatcha say?'. The tension is built heavily leading into this section of the song, with the whispered eponymous 'Hide and Seek', into the emotional delivery of 'Blood and tears // they were here first' - leading cleanly into the first hum. Alternating between the repeated 'mmm, whatcha say' and the questioning lyrics continues to build the tension. Finally - a second layer of her glowing hums comes in under the other, coming together for a final, extended 'What did you say?', resolving the tension in one of the most compelling moments that exists on any song, ever. Even as the song ends - it feels as if every detail is placed with such care. The extended, wispy "Hide and Seek" over the punctuated "You don't care a bit", gently laying the track to rest. All in all - beautiful, creative, and a cornerstone track for heavily modulated and layered vocals for years to come.

Excellent vocals are absolutely a key part of why this album is so good - but it's not the whole story - this album is also extremely well-composed and produced throughout, letting the vocals shine when they need to. On Loose Ends !SM, I absolutely adore the chorus - particularly the "It's complicated" and "Triangulated" - each word punctuated by the percussion under it, giving the chorus this incredible drive. The percussion continues through the bridge, leading into crashing, distorted, almost abrasive cymbals that contrast her clean vocals well - eventually both coming together for an epic end to the song. On 'epic endings' - The Moment I Said It !SM is a perfect closer to this album. A gorgeous, epic final track that takes the listener on a cathartic journey to close everything out. Opening on lone plunks on a piano, gently drawing the listener in. It continues to build and build, the piano intensifying at the repetition of 'no hesitation'. Through the middle, the track continues building the tension with the layered vocals, almost sounding as if they are arguing. Finally, the layers all come together as the piano and her vocals reach their apex, resolving on a single, drawn out 'smash'. Less of the futuristic digital production here - instead proof of her talent as a composer, as this song is wonderfully arranged. Two very different tracks - both excellent and clear demonstrations of her talent. 

Continuing of the theme of production, Heap deserves immense credit for the fact that this album is entirely self-written and self-produced - and independently at that. To manage to execute so well on one's artistic vision, with no outside help (nor financial support) is amazing - and do to so before modern crowd-funding and discovery via social media is immensely impressive. Imagine finding an album like this on bandcamp or similar - it's unreal to think that this level of quality could be basically the result of one artist's vision. Her use of vocal layering, constant vocal-instrumental synergy, and end-to-end delivery of a deeply enjoyable and compelling pop record.

It's clear - this album has fantastic production, fantastic vocals, and standout hits. Though for a long time, Hide and Seek was in the spotlight, in my opinion, there's an even better track on this album - Headlock !SM. On all fronts, Headlock is an exceptional track - from its outstanding instrumental and fantastic vocals, coming together with incredible progression throughout the track - offering the true pinnacle performance of what Imogen Heap has to offer. The start of the track is gentle, with the glittering chimes and glowing vocals to establish the atmosphere. Her voice is clear and direct as the instrumental starts to dance - it feels as if it waltzes fluidly, with a bit of an exploratory or inquisitive feel. Then, a huge drop - the chorus, punctuated with huge stabs of the interwoven synth+vocal and a driving percussion. Into the bridge - we return to the gentle vocals, beautifully composed and layered hums - "I'm just keeping an eye..." - dropping back into the incredible percussion. Finally, the last chorus, as the song peaks: everything element that made the run up to this point so incredible comes back all at once for a true apex. Total euphoria in the last minute of the track. I really appreciate the variation on the word "headlock" as well, with my favorite being the second-to-last time. So much power in a single word, it's incredible. This very well might be my favorite pop song of all time, if you can even call it that. All-in-all: simply an incredible track, perfectly composed and arranged, and deeply, deeply enjoyable.  

There's little that I feel inclined to criticize here - but if I absolutely had to, I'd say that I Am in Love with You !SM may not have the same longevity as the other tracks here. Although a pleasant track - and one with interesting elements in it - it's not as catchy as Loose Ends, not as iconic as Hide and Seek, nor does it have a long life in samples like Headlock or Just for Now. The main instrumental motif is fine, but I could easily see how it'll feel dated in another five or ten years. Moreover, I don't think the progression is incredible. "I am in love with you" to "I'm not in love with you" is a bit on the nose, and is much less evocative than other tracks on the album. The composition here is still excellent, and I certainly enjoy listening to it, but I don't anticipate that it will age as well as the other songs will.

To this day, this album holds up extremely well. I enjoy Headlock, Loose Ends, and The Moment I Said It just as much as any modern pop. I truly believe that if this album came out today, I would still come to love it deeply, due to its sheer quality. However, it's impossible to talk about this album, its aging, and its legacy without mentioning its life in samples. This album has enjoyed a long life in the general audiophile consciousness, in large part due to it being sampled again and again. Some of the most exceptional and enjoyable tracks of all time owe their cornerstone samples to this album. Though I love this songs for what they are, I can't necessarily separate these songs from the songs they helped create. This effect is strongest on Just for Now !SM, which I cannot listen to without hearing I'm God by Clams Casino. That said, that's not at all a bad thing, if anything, it has increased my enjoyment of both. To hear the best parts of this song pulled apart and recontextualized into the best rap instrumental of all time makes me appreciate those elements when I hear them again in the source. Every time I hear the "Can we settle down, please?" with those heavenly vocals and gentle percussion behind it - I realize how much I love both songs. I'm God is probably the most perfect version of this song that exists, but it takes almost every element from Just for Now - and for that, it gets a very high score. Similarly, though Headlock is seeing its own resurgence now - the perfected version of that song already exists: headlock by vowl. An ethereal, atmospheric, euphoric iteration of Headlock, reconfiguring the glowing vocals and upbeat percussion of the original into a chilling, haunting, and deeply compelling modern version. Just like I'm God - with every listen, I grow even more appreciative of the original.

Speak for Yourself is a timeless album - serving as more than just a collection of songs, but as a repository and seed for an ever-growing cultural context of remixes, mashups, and samples. With incredible production, all-time great vocals, and forward-thinking artistic vision, Imogen Heap delivers one of the best albums of all time. I will fully admit - it's difficult to accurately rate an album that I've listened to for so long, as I've had a relationship with it for over a decade now. In that time, though, I truly believe it has proven its longevity, cultural impact, and quality. In every listen of songs that directly sample this album, or in the genres whose trappings still descend from these songs, I hear this album. It has truly earned its dual status: an incredible listen from end-to-end; nearly-genre founding prominence and staying power. In both of these respects, I look forward to spending a number more decades with this album: for the tracks on it, for the tracks that already sample it, and for the tracks that have yet to even be made.
