The Secret of Us
Gracie Abrams

Expectations are the origin of suffering. I really love Good Riddance, and I think Gracie is blessed with one of the best voices, which set my expectations high for this album, especially with the quality of the two singles. Though I like this album - I might even like it a lot - I don't love it, and I'm not by any means blown away.

In my review of Good Riddance, I said that I wish she would experiment more. Does this album have any interesting guitar? Synths? Bass? Voice modulation? No. Barring the actually good production on Close To You, which is functionally a bonus track, this album has generally boring production, but less moving and compelling this time. I love Gracie and her voice deeply, but there's only so many ways to make the same song. As I said before - I'd much rather her experiment and make some 5/10s and some 10/10s, than an album full of 7 and 8/10s. Artists are consistently rewarded for experimenting, especially with production. Look at the new Billie Eilish - there's a lot of super interesting production on that album - and it almost all works well, making it one of the best albums of the year. Unfortunately - this album is characterized mostly by being that 7.5/10.

Felt Good About You is a pleasant opener. I like whatever's going on with the instrumental, and we're immediately reminded that Gracie's voice is really, really excellent, and it's a pleasant listen. To me, the lyrics feel a little simple. Simple isn't bad, but there's certainly more that can be said than 'I felt good about you, until I didn't'. Continuing through the opener - I think Risk is another great song. Very pleasant, catchy, fun listen, with some progression over the course of the song. There's some improved percussion and layering towards the end of the song - moving towards something interesting, but not fully there yet. In my initial review as a single - I hoped that we'd see some real evolution of the sound palette across the course of the album. Though that didn't really happen - it doesn't make Risk any worse of a song - and it's continued to stick with me up until the album release. The third song - Blowing Smoke - also continues the strong opening run, and is my favorite non-single on this album. Her voice is excellent on the song, and it's already very addictive. Her voice as she says 'I know what you are' is just as incredible as ever, and though the guitar line isn't anything special, it is complemented well by her voice and the other elements on the song. 

I Love You, I'm Sorry is by no means a bad song, but I don't think it's the same quality as the first three. I like it - but if this is the spiritual successor to 'i miss you, i'm sorry' - I think it's a letdown. That song is a standout hit for a reason, and I don't feel that retrodding the same ground does her any favors here. I see what this track is going for, but I think it falls a little short. "I'll be on a boat, you're on a plane going somewhere, same". Evocative of the classic parallel-paths trope, but executed poorly. There are much, much better versions of this - Points by Pearson and Lily Potter or Viajar al Metro by Patio Solar wrestle with this parallel paths idea much better - and I can't help but think that Gracie could have done the same.

us. is a momentary lapse in reason and plainly has no reason to exist. I'm not a taylor swift fan - I never have been - and the reason why is more than clear on this song. It is the distillation of this genre and space down to the most marketable possible version with no regard for the sonic quality or artistic integrity. Even if she didn't make a sound on the song, her hands are not clean. It's unbelievably derived to just say the album name over and over: "Wonder if you regret the secret of us, us  Us (_Us_), us (_Us_), us (_Us_)" - and even when she's not doing that, the lyrics are pithy and the instrumentation is unexciting. An unfortunate end to the solid run up unto this point. 

Let it happen is largely a return to form and a pleasant change from the song before. I actually really like the instrumental, and though it's not a standout, it is pleasant, and combined with her absolutely gorgeous vocal performance on the song, it's a good song. Unfortunately, it's immediately followed by Tough Love. I'm really not a fan of this song. One of her weaker vocal moments, and the lyrics aren't particularly meaningful nor do they resonate with me whatsoever. Not that I really resonate with much of her lyrics, but particularly for the song where I might have a chance to as a Boston native, I'm thoroughly unimpressed.

Gave You I Gave You I and Normal Thing are both the 7.5/10 songs that I have come to expect by this point on the record. They start somewhere, they go somewhere else - the journey is somewhat nebulous and they're truly middling if not for her genuinely incredible voice. By this point, I almost feel guilty for enjoying these songs as much as I do. There's a level of internal dissonance for me - I am still totally weak to how incredible her voice is - but everything else doesn't deliver like I wanted it to.  One part of me wants to give everything that has her vocals on it a 10, and the other half of me hears everything else at a 5. Thus - the endless run of 7.5/10s. There are things to praise on each - the end of Gave You I Gave You I is really good, and there's some clear emotion through Normal Thing - but neither manage to break out of the box they easily fit in. 

Moving on to Good Luck Charlie: though I like the soft vocals, I think the reference is really trite, the lyrics are fine, and the instrumentation is quite uninteresting. I find the tambourine to be pretty grating, and though I like that you can hear the strings of the guitar, texturally, it's otherwise quite bland. The male vocals layered under also take away from her voice, which is never a good thing. Much like the ones before it, but a little harder to digest. 

Finally, Free Now. This isn't a bad closer, but I'm not in love with it either. Say what you want about Good Riddance being boring - but there's a very obvious throughline, and whether you believe it to close on Right now or Two people, either way - the album is brought to a nice cathartic and emotional resolution. Is that really the case here? The start of Free Now sounds too much like 'Stay' by Post Malone (that's not a compliment) to really feel gripping, and though I appreciate that it builds, it just doesn't hit me the same way her past work has, and I don't think it's a stunning closer. Like, it's a good closer, but it doesn't make me want to lie down and weep, nor does it bring me deep catharsis. It's good for sure, but not exceptional, as is probably expected by this point on the album run. 

I don't think it's reasonable to include Close To You as a real part of the evaluation of this album - so see my original review: "Great track, Â her voice is as gorgeous as ever and for the first time ever there is actual good production on a Gracie song. Genuinely was shocked to hear a nice bass hit as the first thing on this song." Aaron Dessner is certainly the true enemy.

There was a time I was hoping this might make AOTY for me, or at least be a strong contender. Obviously, that's not the case here. But looking at my current top contenders (boy - 2hollis, and HIT ME HARD AND SOFT - Billie Eilish) - I can't help but see what this album could have been. Boy is entirely self-produced, self-written, and very visceral. An emotional, moving, and unbridled attempt at making something authentic. On the other hand - another gorgeous vocalist - coupled with excellent production and strong ideas throughout. I'm left wishing that this album could have chosen to be more like either of the two, and it would have turned out better. In a conversation with a friend i was asked - What would this album, or Gracie, need to be to get a ten? The simple answer is Speak For Yourself by Imogen Heap. Another absolutely incredible vocalist - but that's just one part of the absolute incredible symphony that that album is. Truly incredible production and vocals that work together so flawlessly, and create a sound that was so far ahead of it's time. I hope that I'll be able to say the same about future releases from Gracie.

In closing, I like this album. I'll continue to listen to it, I'll probably see it live, and I'll certainly end up with it on vinyl. But it's bittersweet, because I know she could do more. In many ways - the album cover is symbolic for the whole album. In many ways boring and lazy - but works, because she is stunningly beautiful. In a musical context - her vocals are so good that the lyrics can be pithy, the instrumentation can beat a horse to death and then some, and the album can go absolutely nowhere, and I will still enjoy it. I'll be wrestling with that for a while. For the album cover, it's much of the same: a pretty face to put on display without truly striving for artistic excellence. I'm going to continue to be a fan of Gracie Abrams, and frequently listen to her work, but I can't say my expectations were met. 

I hope that in the future, Gracie, and other artists, don't cave to the pressures of commercialization, and instead are willing to take risks to create real art that will stand the test of time. I'll be here for her music either way - but I'm not sure how many more iterations of the same song I can really take.
