Despite the name, album cover, and relative unknown status of Devon Again - this EP has some of the most compelling and catchy alt-pop I've ever heard. She's got a great voice, good production, and a good range - from sleeper hits to slow-burn sad songs. Overall - a great EP that deserves drastically more attention and streams than it has received.

HEAD !SM is the obvious standout from this EP - an extremely tight, breakout track that completely transcends the genre. It amazes me that this song only has 8 million streams, as it has the punchy initial listen, and the real staying power of a hit. This whole song is incredible, and peaks insanely hard. That build of 'my head, my head, my head' - with the increasing modulation and percussion make for a super tense build - which is resolved very effectively. Her vocal tone, the crashing percussion, and the great lyrics make the last 30 seconds of this song absolutely exceptional. Masterfully executed, well-composed, total hit material that deserves 100 times as many streams it currently has. In under two minutes - Devon delivers an insane track that continues to hit 24/7, 365.

Although an opposite vibe - my other favorite track is no less excellent. gum v9.1 !SM is an incredible song that's right up my alley - beautiful and gentle vocals, a warm instrumental, and a ripping, vibrant authenticity that cuts right to my heart. This song is a beautiful story of right person, wrong time - and it's very effective at telling that story. The imagery in this song is great - and very poignant. To be a little kid, with gum stuck in your hair - so emblematic of being truly helpless and juvenile. In a similar way - to want a relationship, but not to be ready for one - can be so infantilizing, and that's effectively shown in the chorus here. Sonically, this song is wonderful. Although straightforward, I love the sound of the guitar, and the audible guitar squeaks add very well to the authentic feel of the song. Particularly, during the "Spilling how I feel for you" - the matching strums on the start of the words is so perfect. In addition to the clear elements, the subtler details also contribute well to the song's charming composition. The hums that rise into the chorus, the distance of the bridge, and the layered breathy vocals throughout the track are all fantastic. The song ends on a high note too - the instrumental refrain closes out well. Such a beautiful song that somehow manages to fit all four seasons, night and day.

Those two are certainly my favorites - but there's other great tracks here. The opener, All My Fault !SM, is a great song - showcasing Devon's writing, vocals range, and production skills - all of which come through well on those songs. Broke Mine Too !SM is great for the same reasons, although a little less great in my opinion. Both songs have a straightforward but sufficient structure, with nice moments and choruses, with some appreciable peaks. On All My Fault, I really like the transition from the verse into the chorus - and the contrast between the two sections. It displays her vocal range well - and I'm a particular fan of the high-pitched, breathy vocals during the chorus. Similarly, on Broke Mine Too, the chorus + post-chorus is excellent. The simple guitar that drops into those digital stabs and punchy bass hits feels engaging and energetic. Both of these songs have great replay value, and are easily accessible, enjoyable pop tracks.

If there's a misstep on this album, it's Shitty People !SM. There's a lot to like about it - Devon's bends up to falsetto vocals are as good as ever - and the tone of those notes in the intro are great! That said, the song isn't great otherwise. It's a bit disorganized, and feels less coherent than the other songs here: it lacks the tightness of HEAD, the end-to-end charm of gum v9.1, and the quality structure of All My Fault. Devon's writing is great on other songs - but less so here. On gum and HEAD, there's a deep introspective guilt, which is very compelling. Here, that's been replaced with a bitterness that feels more like ego than growth. Although her voice is great - it's not so compelling when it's about "smelly shoes", especially accompanied by those overmixed kicks. 

Finally, Maybe That's Why - a pretty epic ending to this excellent EP. This song is very well composed, and a nice closer to the album. Throughout the track, I like how the bass contrasts her high-pitched vocals - and both are enriched by some staccato modulation. Particularly in the prechorus, the dragged out 'overheating' and 'ever' are really tasteful, and apt for the imagery. The end of this song - which is of course, the end of the album - is fantastic. The bridge at the end, ending with the powerful line - "I still can't forgive myself for who I have become" - with her gentle vocals and guitar trailing off... Then - glowing vocals, deep reverberant bass, and a vocal refrain that's fantastic. The vocal layers, instrumental texture, and the moment when the percussion comes back in all make this a wonderful closer to a great EP.

Overall - I love this EP. Yes, it's a bit strange, underappreciated, and imperfect at times. Understanding that, though, it's a charming and highly replayable set of songs that represent an authentic effort from a great artist. Standout hits, slow songs, and easy-listening pop; on this ep, Devon kind of does it all! I absolutely loved hearing her live when she opened for Maude Latour, and I hope she'll headline a tour of her own soon. Until then, I'll be listening to this EP, and keep finding ways to sneak HEAD and gum onto my playlists.
